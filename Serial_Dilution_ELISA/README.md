* Prepare the ELISA plate by pre-washing with EGRF and let the solution sit
for the specified number of hours. Then wash the plate with wash buffer 4x and superblock.

* Serial dilution to 1000 ng/mL:
  - Dilution 1: Dilute from sample starting concentration to 50 ug/mL
  - Dilution 2: Dilute to yield final concentration of 1000 ng/mL

* Prepare five-fold serial dilutions of reference and samples.

* Place the diluted samples in the ELISA reaction plate.

* Wash plate again with wash buffer 4x.

* Put in secondary antibody.

* Stop reaction with TMB and sulfuric acid.

### Time Estimate
