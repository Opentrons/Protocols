Transfer 200 uL (default) of patient sample from patient tube in deck slot 4 position B1 into well B1 of the KingFisher deep well plate.\n3.

Transfer 200 uL (default) of patient sample from patient tube in deck slot 4 position B1 into well C1 of the KingFisher deep well plate.\n4. Transfer 200 uL (default) of patient sample from patient tube in deck slot 4 position B1 into well D1 of the KingFisher deep well plate.\n5. This process will continue aliquoting the same patient sample twice and will do up to 47 patient samples per run.\nNote: Samples are not aliquoted into wells G12 and H12.
