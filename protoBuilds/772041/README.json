The user can choose how many wells to transfer to (rounding up to the nearest number of columns) as well as how much volume to add to each well. The user can also choose whether they want to reuse tips, or pick up new tips for each transfer\nExplanation of parameters below:\n Number of wells: How many wells to transfer mastermix to on the target plate. This will be rounded up to the nearest number of full columns.\n Volume of mastermix: Volume of mastermix to add to each well (\u00b5L)\n* Reuse tips?: Yes: Reuse tips when distributing the mastermix. No: Drop the tips after each distribution, and pick up new tips before each aspiration.\n",
