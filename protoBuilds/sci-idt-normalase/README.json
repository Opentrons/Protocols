    "description": "This is the Normalase protocol that follows the Normalase PCR that is done after the usual fragmentation, End-Repair, A-tailing, and Ligation. The Ligation would have been performed with either a full length adapter ligation using the Normalase Reagent R5, or a stubby universal adapter followed by the barcoded stubby Normalase adapters in the PCR. This protocol follows that modified PCR that can be adapted into other NGS Library preps, before starting the prepared, amplified libraries should be cleaned and quantified, samples must be at least 5ul of 12nM for efficient Normalization. See the IDT Normalase protocol for more information.\nEXAMPLE PROTOCOL SETUP\nThis is an example setup for 24 samples that will be pooled into 3 pools of 8 samples each. The first step is a reaction on the thermocycler, afterwards the plate is transferred to Pos 1 and a new plate for pooled samples and additional reactions goes on the thermocycler. This protocol will pool 5ul of each sample individually with a single channel pipette according to\nthe setup below.
