    "description": "\n\nThis protocol preps a 96 well plate with sample and mastermix for PCR. See below for details on reagent setup, protocol steps, etc. Tube racks should be placed in order of the slot numbers on the deck, (1, 2, 3,...,7). The pipette will access each tube rack in this order beginning from tube rack 1 on slot 1. The pipettes will access each tuberack by column (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2...), meaning a 94 sample run would have all tube racks in slots 1-6 filled, with 4 tubes in A1, B1, C1, A2 of slot 7.\n\n\nIf running a full plate (94 samples), the protocol will use the multi-channel pipette to dispense mastermix to all 96 wells. If running less than 94 samples, say 12 for example, the protocol will use the multi-channel to dispense mastermix into the first column, then the single channel to dispense the first four wells of column 2, then finally mastermix into G12, H12. Note, in this example, that the pipette will be taking mastermix from whichever column it is taking from (1 or 2, dependent on the number of samples running), in which case extra mastermix should be provided for the first four wells of column 1.\n\n\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples (1-94): Specify the number of samples for this run (1-94).\n Reaction plate: Specify whether using the non-skirted or half-skirted reaction plate on slot 9. Slot 8 should always use a non-skirted plate. \n* P20/P300 Pipette Mounts: Specify which mount (left or right) to host each pipette.\n",
