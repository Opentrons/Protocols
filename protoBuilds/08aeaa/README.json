    "description": "\nThis protocol performs the normalization of samples by adjusting the concentration in Micronic 96 rack. Once normalized it will transfer nuclease-free water to the corresponding wells in a PCR plate and then transfer samples to the corresponding wells in the PCR plate.\nIn this protocol, the ThermoFisher Nunc 96 Well Plate 2mL is used as the reservoir for water. You can define the volume of water placed in each well at the Water Reservoir Volume per Well parameter below. By default this value is 1500 uL. The robot will assume that each well it needs has a volume of 1500 uL and will keep track of how much water it has used per well before moving onto a new well. While, it keeps track of the volume per well, it will also adjust the height of how low the pipette moves to aspirate.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 App\nOpentrons Single-Channel Pipettes and corresponding Tips\n\nFor more detailed information on compatible labware, please visit our Labware Library.\n\n\nCSV Format\nYour file must be saved as a comma separated value (.csv) file type.
