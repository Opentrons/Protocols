        "protocol-steps": "1. [Off-robot manual step] The protocol begins with the manual addition of 720\u00b5L of CSPL Buffer + Proteinase K (700+20) to each sample.\n2. After initial incubation is complete, user can manually transfer 500\u00b5L of starting material to deepwell plate and place on Mag Deck or (if using Qiagen tubes) place empty deepwell plate on Mag Deck and samples onto OT-2 deck for automated transfer.\n3. If automating the initial sample transfer, 500\u00b5L will be transferred to the 96-Well deepwell plate. Otherwise, OT-2 steps will begin with step 4.\n4. 525\u00b5L of RNase A + RBB Buffer + Mag-Bind Beads (5+500+20) is transferred to each column containing samples.\n5. A 10 minute incubation period will begin. During this period, the OT-2 will mix each column for ~30 seconds before moving to the next column. In the case of 1 column of samples, the OT-2 will mix for ~30 seconds, then stop for 30 seconds before resuming the mix again.\n6. After incubating, the Mag Deck engages, and after the pellet forms, 1080\u00b5L is transferred to the NEST 1-Well Reservoir for liquid waste.\n7. 500\u00b5L of CSPW1 Buffer is added to each column of samples and mixed.\n8. After incubating on the Mag Deck, 600\u00b5L is transferred to the liquid waste.\n9. 500\u00b5L of CSPW2 Buffer is added to each column of samples and mixed.\n10. After incubating on the Mag Deck, 600\u00b5L is transferred to the liquid waste.\n11. 500\u00b5L of SPM Buffer (wash 1) is added to each column of samples and mixed.\n12. After incubating on the Mag Deck, 600\u00b5L is transferred to the liquid waste.\n13. 500\u00b5L of SPM Buffer (wash 2) is added to each column of samples and mixed.\n14. After incubating on the Mag Deck, the final wash removal volume stated is transferred to the liquid waste.\n15. [Optional] If the user selects to \"add water before air dry\", the pipette will slowly aspirate and dispense 100\u00b5L of nuclease-free water to each column of samples.\n16. A 10 minute incubation begins, at which point, the user should fill the reagent reservoir with the warmed Elution Buffer.\n17. Once the incubation period is over, the Elution Buffer is added to the samples on the Mag Deck.\n18. The user is prompted to remove the Plate on the Mag Deck and incubate at 65C.\n19. Once the incubation is complete, the user returns the Plate to the Mag Deck.\n20. The Mag Deck engages and after the pellet forms, the elution is transferred to the PCR plate.\n\n",
        "reagent-setup": "Reagents for this protocol are split between two [NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL](https://shop.opentrons.com/nest-12-well-reservoirs-15-ml/).

In this example, each channel can hold enough reagent for up to 3 columns of samples (24 total samples).
