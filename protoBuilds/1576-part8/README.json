This particular section is part 8 of the series, products of part 7 are amplified by PCR using primers that specifically bind to the P5-P7 sequences on Illumina adapters. Target Pure\u2122 NGS clean-up beads are then used to clean-up the amplified captured library.\nBefore you start, review the protocol guide to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables.
