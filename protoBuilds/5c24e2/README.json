Update: this protocol has been updated to accommodate the SSI 384-well plate as well.\n\nThe protocol can fill one or two, 384-well plates. The P20 Single-Channel Pipette will aspirate 5\u00b5L from each well of the NEST 96-Well Plates and dispense 2.5\u00b5L into two wells of the (A1 --> A1/B1; B1 --> C1/D1; etc.)\n\nUpdate (10/22/20): The protocol will now aspirate 10\u00b5L and dispense 5\u00b5L into two wells.\n\nUpdate (11/2/20): The protocol will now aspirate 20\u00b5L and dispense 10\u00b5L into two wells. Additionally, the option to use the p300-multi pipette has been added.\nUpdated (11/12/20): A new parameter has been added that allows the user to input the volume (in \u00b5L) of sample that should be transferred.
