    "description": "This protocol fills Applied Biosystems MicroAmp 384-well plates with mastermix. Update: this protocol can now accomodate the SSI 384-well plate as well.\n\nThe protocol can fill up to 9 plates and will dispense 7.5\u00b5L of mastermix 1 into all the odd rows (A/C/E...) and 7.5\u00b5L of mastermix 2 into all the even rows (B/D/F...).\n\nThis protocol has been updated to use the GEN2 Multi-Channel Pipettes - please use corresponding tips.\n\nUpdate 09-21-20: The protocol will now do a blow out in the well and aspirate 2\u00b5L of air at the top of the well after each dispense step to ensure all liquid has been expelled from pipette and minimize contamination risk due to droplet hang.\n\nUpdate 09-25-20: The protocol has been updated in two ways. First, the mastermix should be split between two wells (A1/A2 and A11/A12). Second, after aspirating the mastermix, the pipette will move to the sides of the well to remove liquid attached to the tips.\n\nUpdate 10-29-20: The protocol will now transfer 10\u00b5L of mastermix.\n\nUpdate 10-30-20: The protocol will now multi-dispense mastermix instead of 1-to-1 transfer. \n\nUpdate 11-12-20: The protocol now has a new parameter for master mix volume (default is 7.5\u00b5L)\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons Tips\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir\nApplied Biosystems MicroAmp 384-Well Plate or SSI 384-Well Plate\nReagents (mastermix 1, mastermix 2)\n\n\n\nSlots 1 - 9: Applied Biosystems MicroAmp 384-Well Plate or SSI 384-Well Plate\nSlot 10: Opentrons Tips\nSlot 11: NEST 12-Well Reservoir\nA1: Mastermix 1 (for plates 1-5)\nA2: Mastermix 1 (for plates 6-9)\nA11: Mastermix 2 (for plates 1-5)\nA12: Mastermix 2 (for plates 6-9)\n\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n Pipette Type: Select which GEN2 Multi-Channel Pipette (p300 or p20) will be used\n Pipette Mount: Select which mount (left or right) the Multi-Channel Pipette is attached to\n Number of Plates (1-9): Specify the number of plates to fill\n Plate (384-Well) Type: Select which plate (Applied Biosystems or SSI) to use\n* Master Mix Volume (uL): Input the volume of master mix to be transferred to each well",
