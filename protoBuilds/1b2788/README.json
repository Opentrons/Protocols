Please find a description of the kit below from Zymo's website:\nThe Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe 96 Magbead Kits are designed for the simple and rapid isolation of inhibitor-free, PCR-quality host cell and microbial DNA from a variety of sample sources, including humans, birds, rats, mice, cattle, etc. The procedure is easy and can be completed in as little as 90 minutes: fecal samples are rapidly and efficiently lysed by bead beating with our state of the art, ultra-high density BashingBeads. Zymo MagBinding Bead technology, which features Zymo Research's Inhibitor Removal technology, is then used to isolate the DNA. Eluted DNA is ideal for downstream molecular-based applications including PCR, arrays, genotyping, methylation detection, etc.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* Number of Columns: Specify the number of sample columns in this run (1-12).\n* Pre-Wash buffer volume (ul): Specify wash volumes for both the pre-wash buffer, and gDNA wash buffer in microliters. Volumes can be greater than 200ul, and will be split if need be over multiple transfers.\n* Elute Buffer Volume: Specify the elute buffer volume in microliters.\n* P300 Multi-Channel Pipette Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 multi-channel pipette.\n",
