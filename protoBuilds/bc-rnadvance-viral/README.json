    "description": "This protocol performs viral RNA isolation on up to 96 samples using the Beckman Coulter RNAdvance Viral RNA Isolation kit and workflow.\nThe protocol begins at the stage of adding binding beads to lysed samples loaded on the magnetic module in a NEST 96-deepwell plate. For reagent layout in the 2 12-channel reservoirs used in this protocol, please see \"Setup\" below.\nFor sample traceability and consistency, samples are mapped directly from the magnetic extraction plate (magnetic module, slot 6) to the elution PCR plate (temperature module, slot 1). Magnetic extraction plate well A1 is transferred to elution PCR plate A1, extraction plate well B1 to elution plate B1, ..., D2 to D2, etc.\n\n \nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons Magnetic Module (GEN2\nOpentrons Temperature Module (GEN2)\nOpentrons P300 8-Channel Electronic Pipette (GEN2)\nBeckman Coulter RNAdvance Viral kit\nNEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL, 2x\nNEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL\nNEST 96 Well Plate 100 \u00b5L PCR Full Skirt\nNEST 96 Deepwell Plate 2mL\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 \u00b5L, up to 10x depending on throughput\n\n\n\n\n\nEntire deck\n\n\n\nReservoir 1: slot 2\n\nReservoir 2: slot 3\n\n\nVolumes per reservoir channel: (for 96-sample run, not including dead volume):\n 10mL of 100% Isopropanol + 250uL of bead BBD\n 10mL of Wash WBE\n 10mL of 70% Ethanol\n 4mL of nuclease-free water",
