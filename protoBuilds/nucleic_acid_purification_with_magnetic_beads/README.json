This protocol contains flexible parameters that you can customize for many different magnetic bead and nucleic acid types.

We recommend using a p50 or p300 multi- or single-channel.\nPipette Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) your pipette is on.\nSample number: Customize the number of samples to run per protocol. A multiple of 8 is recommended when you are using a multichannel pipette.\nSample volume: Specify the starting volume (in uL) of the input sample.\nBead Ratio: Customize the ratio of beads for left or right side size-selection of fragments. The default bead ratio is 1.8x the input sample volume.\nElution Volume: Specify the final volume (in uL) to elute the purified nucleic acid. The Opentrons MagDeck supports elution volumes above 10 \u00b5L.\nIncubation Time: Specify the amount of time (in minutes) that the bead solution and input sample interact.\nSettling Time: Specify the amount of time (in minutes) needed to pellet the beads.
