    "description": "This protocol automates RNA extraction according to the 3D Black Bio RNA Extraction Kit.\n\nUsing the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette, this protocol can accommodate up to 96 samples per run and can be configured to run any multiple of 8 up to 96. Starting with at least 200\u00b5L of sample in a standard 96-well plate, the entire process is automated and ends with 60\u00b5L of elution containing RNA dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate. The elution is then ready for RT/qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, hybridization, etc.\n\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 4.0.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module, GEN2\nOpentrons P300 Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tips (recommended) or Opentrons 300\u00b5L Tips\nNEST 96-Deep Well Plate, 2mL\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir\nOpentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block\nPCR Tubes\n3D Black Bio Extraction Kit\nSamples\n\n\n\nReagent Preparation\nPrepare all reagents according to manual.\n\nProteinase K: At least 10\u00b5L (12\u00b5L is recommended) per column of samples should fill a PCR Strip.\nThe PCR strip should be placed in column 1 of the Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block\n\nMagBeads: At least 20\u00b5L (22\u00b5L is recommended) per column of samples should fill 1 (or 2, if processing more than 48 samples) PCR strip(s).\nThe PCR strip(s) should be placed in column(s) 3 (and 4, if processing more than 48 samples) of the Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block\n\nLysis-Binding Mix: In slots 1-6 of the NEST 12-Well Reservoir.\nFor every column (8 samples), 7mL of Lysis-Binding Mix should be added to the reservoir.
