    "description": "This protocol automates RNA extraction according to the 3D Black Bio RNA Extraction Kit.\n\nUsing the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette, this protocol can accommodate up to 96 samples per run and can be configured to run any multiple of 8 up to 96. Starting with at least 200\u00b5L of sample in a standard 96-well plate, the entire process is automated and ends with 60\u00b5L of elution containing RNA dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate.
