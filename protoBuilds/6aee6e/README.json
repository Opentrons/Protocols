It uses 2 custom labwares, transferring 10ul of ammonia from a 50mL tube to a custom 99 well plate, then transferring 5ul of Ytrium from a custom 96 well plate on a shaker. This is repeated 96 times until all wells from the custom 96 well plate have been transferred.\n\n\n\nOpentrons P20-single channel electronic pipettes (GEN2)\nOpentrons 20ul Filter Tips\nNEST 50mL centrifuge tubes\n",
