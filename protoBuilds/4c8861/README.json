    "description": "This protocol normalizes up to (3) 96 well plates with diluent from 3 source plates to 3 destination plates. Destination plates exactly mirror source plates. The protocol begins by transferring diluent to all relevant wells in all 3 plates (up to 96 for each plate), and then continues to do a 1-1 well to well transfer between the source and destination plates. A csv is parsed to determine the transfer volume for each well of each plate.\nSince the samples are temperature sensitive, the source plates are only loaded onto the deck one at a time, with the protocol pausing after all the diluent is added, and after each source plate is transferred. There is no mixing step in this protocol.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n CSV Sample: Upload the csv sample with the following header line:\nPlate number |  Well |  Concentration (ng/ul) | Diluent Volume (ul) |   Sample volume (ul) |    Total volume (ul) | Desired concentration(ng/ul)\n Reset Tipracks: Select yes to pick up the tip from A1 on the 200ul tip rack. Select no to pick up tip on the tip rack from where the previous run left off.\n Include pauess: Select yes to include pause steps after buffer is added and in between source plates that are completed. Select no otherwise. \n P20 Multi-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 multi-channel pipette.\n* P300 Single-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 single-channel pipette.\n",
