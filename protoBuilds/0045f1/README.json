The user has the ability to manipulate the spacing between the dots, as well as the volume of the dispenses. The user can also specify the number of slides spotted. Please see below for the order in which slides are spotted.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* Number of tubes: Specify the number of tubes this protocol will run.\n* Number of Slides: Specify the number of slides for this run (1-6).\n* Spot Spacing: Specify the spacing between dots on the slide wells.\n* Spot Volume: Specify the volume of each dot.\n* Aspiration Flow Rate: Specify the aspiration rate. A value of 1 is the default rate, a value of 1.2 is a 20% increase of the default rate, a value of 0.5 is half of the default rate.\n* Dispense Flow Rate: Specify the dispense rate. A value of 1 is the default rate, a value of 1.2 is a 20% increase of the default rate, a value of 0.5 is half of the default rate.\n* P20 Single-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 single-channel pipette.\n",
