    "description": "This protocol performs normalization for the Illimuina RNA Prep with Enrichment protocol. Normalization is the method of adding buffer to a set of samples so that their concentrations are uniform. This is usually so that they can be treated uniformly in subsequent steps. For example, after NGS library prep of multiple samples, the samples are normalized to the same concentration, so that the same volume of each sample can be pooled, and each sample is represented in equal proportions. A requirement for this Normalization protocol is that the concentrations and volumes are known i.e. previously quantified by Picogreen and aliquoted into a plate at a set volume, and formatted\nin a .csv file as input.\nYou should upload a .csv file formatted in the following way, being sure to include the header line:\nSample_Plate,Sample_well,InitialVol,InitialConc,TargetConc\nsample_plate,A1,20,2.3,2\nsample_plate,B1,20,3.99,2\nsample_plate,C1,20,4.39,2\nsample_plate,D1,20,3.95,2\nsample_plate,E1,20,4.16,2\nsample_plate,F1,20,3.81,2\nsample_plate,G1,20,3.96,2\nsample_plate,H1,20,3.41,2\n",
