    "description": "This protocol automates the creation of a mastermix (containing OptiMEM, DNA samples, and Viafect) and then dispenses this mastermix in triplicate. Using a simple CSV and a couple key parameters, this protocol can be easily adjusted for diifferent scenarios.\n\nThe protocol begins by adding 5.3\u00b5L of OptiMEM to the number of wells as defined by the user (the last well can receive more). After this, 4.4\u00b5L of DNA will be added to the wells per the CSV, transferring from sample tubes in deck slot 4 to the mastermix tubes in deck slot 5 (with OptiMEM). The OT-2 will then add 1.3\u00b5L of Viafect to the mastermix wells and pause until the user is ready to resume. After resuming, the OT-2 will transfer 10\u00b5L of the mastermix, in triplicate, to a 96-well plate in deck slot 6.\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons P20 Single-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons P20 Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\nOpentrons Aluminum Block Set\nOpentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set\nCorning 96-Well Plate, 360\u00b5L Flat\n1.5mL Microcentrifuge Tube\nPCR Strips, 200\u00b5L\n\n\n\nDeck Setup\n\nSlot 1: Opentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\nSlot 2: Opentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\nSlot 3: Opentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\nSlot 4: Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block with PCR Strips containing samples/stock\nSlot 5: Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block with empty PCR Strips on the left for mastermix creation (columns 1-4) and a PCR Strip containing Viafect (column 12)\nSlot 6: Corning 96-Well Plate, 360\u00b5L Flat\nSlot 7: Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set with a 1.5mL Microcentrifuge Tube containing OptiMEM in D6\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n* Transfer CSV: Upload a CSV that will dictate the transfer of DNA from deck slot 4 to deck slot 5 (see below for more detail)\n* Number of Mastermix: Specify the number of mastermixes to be created (1-32).\n* Extra OptiMEM: Specify whether the last mastermix tube should receive 31.7\u00b5L of OptiMEM or the standard 5.3\u00b5L\n\n\nCSV Layout\n\n\n\nThe CSV should consist of two columns with headers, Source Well and Destination Well.
