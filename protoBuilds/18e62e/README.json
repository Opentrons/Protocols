Using up to four KingFisher 96-Well Plates as inputs and an Opentrons Temperature Module to keep reagents cool, this protocol transfers water, primer/probes, and master mix to necessary wells in 384-Well Plate before transferring samples from the KingFisher plates.\nThis protocol is still a work in progress and will be updated.\nUpdate 2021-10-25: A new parameter was added (Only Transfer Samples) that will skip the addition of reaction mix components and use of the temperature module; instead, simply transferring samples from 96-well plates to 384-well plate.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Plate 1 Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples in Plate 1 (up to 96). The plate can be skipped by setting this value to 0 (zero).\n Plate 2 Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples in Plate 2 (up to 96). The plate can be skipped by setting this value to 0 (zero).\n Plate 3 Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples in Plate 3 (up to 96). The plate can be skipped by setting this value to 0 (zero).\n Plate 4 Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples in Plate 4 (up to 96). The plate can be skipped by setting this value to 0 (zero).\n Pipette Mount: Select which mount the P20 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN2) is attached to.\n Used Tip Location: Select where used tips should be dropped after transferring samples. Empty Tip Rack is recommended due to space constraints in the waste bin.\n",
