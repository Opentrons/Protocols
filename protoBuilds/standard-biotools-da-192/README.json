    "description": "\n\nThis protocol transfers 4 \u00b5L of samples and assays from 96-well plates to the Standard BioTools 192.24 IFC (Integrated Fluidic Circuit)\n\n\nPreparation:\nBefore beginning the protocol on the OT-2, perform the following preparation steps:\n1. Prepare the Samples, the Assays, and the IFC Referring as described in one of the following workflows from the Standard BioTools X9 User Guide:\n- Gene Expression Using the 192.24 IFC with TaqMan Assays\n- Genotyping Using the 192.24 IFC with SNP Type Assays\n- Genotyping Using the 192.24 IFC with TaqMan Assays\n2. Prepare two Sample Plates by transferring 6 \u00b5L of sample to all wells of two separate 96-well plates\n3. Prepare an Assay Plate by transferring 6 \u00b5L of assay to 24 wells of a 96-well plate\n4. NOTE: All wells (indicated below in blue) must have liquid\n5. Centrifuge the Sample and Assay plates to ensure liquids are at the bottom of the wells\n6. Prepare the 192.24 IFC:\n- Add control line fluid to the accumulators according to the workflow selected in step 1 (Indicated above by red arrows)\n- Remove the protective film from the bottom of the IFC\n7. Prepare a 1.5 mL tube with 170 \u00b5L Standard Biotools Actuation Fluid (green)\n8. Prepare a 1.5 mL tube with 370 \u00b5L Standard Biotools Pressure Fluid (red)",
