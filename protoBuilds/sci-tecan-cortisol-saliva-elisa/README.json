    "description": "Tecan\u2019s Cortisol Saliva ELISA (REF 30172091, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) is an enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative determination of free cortisol in human saliva. It is a competitive ELISA which the target antigen (free cortisol in specimen) competes with a reference antigen (fixed amount of HRP-labelled cortisol) for binding the anti-cortisol antibody pre-coated on the plate. A substrate for HRP is then added into the mixture to produce the photometric signal. The more the target antigen is present in the sample, the less the reference antigen can be captured by the antibody and the weaker the signal produced; therefore, the intensity of the developed color is inversely proportional to the amount of the target antigen in the sample.\nThe protocol performs transferring of the samples and reference antigen (Enzyme Conjugate) into the ELISA plate (Microtiter Plate, 8-well strips coated with rabbit anti-cortisol antibody) to allow the antibody to bind to the antigen. After a 2-hour incubation and washing, TMB Substrate Solution is transferred into the ELISA plate to develop photometric signal which can be measured on a microplate reader at 450 nm.\nMaterials provided in the kit:\n1.  Rabbit anti-cortisol antibody coated microtiter plate (8-well strip x12)\n2.  HRP-conjugated cortisol (Enzyme Conjugate)\n3.  Cortisol Standards and Positive Controls\n4.  TMB Substrate Solution \n5.  TMB Stop Solution\n6.  Wash Buffer (10X)\nOther materials required:\n1.  Slit seal (BioChromato, Fujisawa, Japan)\n2.  NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL \n3.  NEST 96 Deep Well Plate 2mL\n4.  Opentrons Tip Rack, 300 \u00b5L\n5.  Nunc 96-Well Polypropylene Storage Microplates (Cat. #: 249947, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) or compatible \n6.  Microplate Reader\nPipettes and Modules\n1.  Opentrons P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)\n2.  Heater Shaker Module (GEN1) with Aluminum Adaptor for 96-well Flat Plate\nDeck setup:\nPlease see the deck layout as the general guideline for labware setup. \n1.  The ELISA plate is sealed with a slit seal and placed on the Heater Shaker Module (Slot 3). \n2.  Samples or sample dilutions are pre-loaded in the Nunc 96-Well Polypropylene Storage Microplates, the SAMPLES plate (Slot 1).\n3.  The REAGENTS plate (Slot 4) is filled with Enzyme Conjugate in Column 1, TMB Substrate Solution in Column 2, and TMB Stop Solution in Column 3\nNote: See Reagent Step for reagent plate preparation\n4.  For WASH (Slot 5), sufficient wash buffer is filled in each well for 4 washes of 250 \u03bcL.\n5.  Three boxes of Opentrons 96 tips (Slot 7, 10, and 11) are sufficient to run a full 96-well ELISA plate (12 8-well strips).\n6.  The WASTE plate is loaded at Slot 9.",
