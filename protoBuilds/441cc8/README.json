This process is repeated for all columns of the primer plate to fill all columns of the 9 PCR plates.\nThe liquid handling method used for the master mix includes the following features:\nslow flow rate for aspiration and dispense\nwait for liquid to finish moving after aspiration and dispense\navoid introducing air into liquid (avoid complete dispenses)\ndispense to a surface\nwithdraw tip slowly from liquid\nLinks:\n Deck Layout\n Process Steps\nWith this protocol, your robot can prepare stock plates containing master mix and indexing primers to be used for the indexing step of an NGS library prep workflow.",
