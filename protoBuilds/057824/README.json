    "description": "This protocol uses the heater-shaker module, magnetic module, single-channel P20, and single-channel P300 pipette to perform mass spec sample prep for up to 96 input samples. A user-input-specified volume of reducing agent is added to samples on the heater-shaker at 60 degrees C followed by shaking at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds. After a 30 minute incubation, a user-input-specified volume of alkylating agent is added followed by shaking and incubation at room temperature. A second addition of reducing agent is followed by a series of incubations, shaking, bead binding, washes, digestion and recovery of digestion products to the final plate.

Upon reaching the target temperature, V(RED first time) will be dispensed to the northern-side-wall of each sample-containing well of the working plate on the heater shaker by either the p20 single or p300 single followed by shaking at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds.\n4. The OT-2 will wait for a 30 minute on-deck incubation (with passive cooling of the heater shaker initiated during the incubation).\n5. The OT-2 will then wait for the necessary additional length of time needed for the target temperature to be reached (passive cooling).\n6. V(ALK) will be dispensed to the southern-side-wall of each sample-containing well of the working plate on the heater shaker by either the p20 single or p300 single followed by shaking at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds and then another 30 minute incubation.\n7. V(RED second time) will be dispensed to the eastern-side-wall of each sample-containing well of the working plate on the heater shaker by either the p20 single or p300 single followed by a 15 minute incubation.\n8. V(Bead Mixture) will be dispensed to the western-side-wall of each sample-containing well of the working plate on the heater shaker by either the p20 single or p300 single followed by shaking at 1500 rpm for 30 seconds.\n9. V(ACN calculated) will be dispensed to each sample-containing well of the working plate on the heater shaker by the p300 single with the tip dropped into a sample-specific location in the empty tip rack (for later reuse).\n10. The heater shaker will perform nine iterations of (1500 rpm 30 sec, 100 rpm 90 sec).\n11. The OT-2 will pause and prompt the user to relocate the working plate to the magnetic module.\n12. After engaging magnets and waiting, the p300 single will discard bead pellet supernatants to the reservoir.\n13. The p300 single and magnetic module will perform two washes of beads with 80 percent ethanol and one wash with 100 uL ACN (includes mixing and resuspension of beads in the ethanol or ACN).\n14. V(DIG) will be top dispensed directly above (1 mm from side of the well) each washed bead pellet.\n15. The OT-2 will pause and prompt the user to relocate the working plate back to the heater shaker.\n16. The heater shaker will perform a single iteration of (1500 rpm 2 min, 1000 rpm sustained until the user signals readiness to stop heating and shaking by providing user input - by clicking \"resume\" in the OT app).\n17. The OT-2 will pause and prompt the user to relocate the working plate back to the magnetic module.\n18.
