    "description": "This protocol performs Select-a-Size MagBead Clean-up for the Zymo-Seq RiboFree\u2122 Total RNA Library Prep. This protocol is meant to be run on a second OT-2 in conjunction with another OT-2 running the rest of the library prep (first strand cDNA synthesis, universal depletion, P7 and P5 adapter ligations, and library index PCR).\nSamples will be processed down columns and then across rows (A1, B1, C1, ... A2, B2, etc.). Thoroughly mix reagent tubes thoroughly by flicking or pipetting before starting. Briefly spin down and load onto the temperature module according to Setup below.\nThe user is prompted to replace tipracks mid-protocol when necessary (for > 76 samples).\nLinks:\n First Strand cDNA Synthesis and RiboFreeTM Universal Depletion (robot 1)\n P7 Adapter Ligation (robot 1)\n P5 Adapter Ligation (robot 1)\n Library Index PCR (robot 1)\n* Select-a-Size Magbead Clean-up (robot 2)\n\n\n\nOpentrons Temperature Module GEN2\nOpentrons Magnetic Module GEN2 for NEST 96-well PCR plate, full skirt\nNEST 12-channel reservoir 15ml\nOpentrons P20 and P300 GEN2 multi-channel pipettes\nOpentrons 20\u00b5l and 50/300\u00b5l tipracks\n\n\n\n12-channel reservoir (slot 2)\n",
