    "description": "This protocol performs custom emulsions via two uploaded csv files - one for the aqueous solutions (slot 10) and another for the oil solutions (slot 11). Touch tips and delays are instilled after aspirations, and blowouts are instilled after dispensing from the top of the well. One liquid solution is dispensed at a time into as many rows that are provided in the csv. If a value of 0 is passed in the csv, the pipette will skip that well. For volumes less than 300ul, the P300 single channel pipette is used, otherwise for volumes 300-1000ul, the P1000 pipette is used. All aspirations and dispenses are in order of row for all racks and plates.\n\n\nThe csv should be formatted like so. Note that it should include the header, as well as a second row describing the initial volume in each tube in milliliters to ensure liquid height tracking, and avoid submerging the pipette plunger in solution. The aqueous and oil csv files do not necessarily need to have the same number of columns (liquid number), but they should have the same number of rows (up to 144 rows).\n",
