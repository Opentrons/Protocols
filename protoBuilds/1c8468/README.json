    "description": "This protocol transfers samples from a source plate to one of two target plates (to later undergo PCR) as specified in the uploaded CSV file. Samples from each well in the source plate are distributed to its corresponding target plate 6 columns apart. In the case that one of the target plates is filled, the user is prompted to replace it and resume the protocol. In the case that the source plate is depleted, the user is prompted to replace the source plate and upload its respective CSV file to this webpage, download, and run again. In the latter case, the OT-2 \"remembers\" what wells on the target plate are already filled when a new source plate is introduced (unless user resets the counter - see below). User will also be prompted to replace tip racks during a run if applicable.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.15.0 or later)\nP20 Single Pipette\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 20 \u00b5L\nThermoScientific 96-well Plate 200\u00b5l\n\n\n\nFor this protocol, be sure that the pipettes (P20 and P300) are attached.\nUsing the customization fields below, set up your protocol.\n Source Plate CSV: Upload a CSV corresponding with the source plate loaded onto the deck.\n Transfer Volume: Specify the volume (\u00b5L) desired for each well in target plates\n P20 Single Mount: Specify which mount the P10 is on (left or right).\n Reset Counter: Reset the counter if running with empty target plates.
