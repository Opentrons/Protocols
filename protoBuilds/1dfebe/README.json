    "description": "This protocol preps a 96 well plate with urine and enzyme hydrolysis, as well as trichloroacetic acid and dilution buffer. The urine samples in the 4 tube racks exactly mimic the 96 well plate with 15 controls already put in by column. The sample pick-off begins from D2 in the tuberack on slot one, corresponding to H2 of the well plate in slot 3 for dispensing. Delays and pauses are included in the protocol to allow for incubation periods and mix steps.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* Use csv for this run?: Specify whether a csv file will be uploaded for this run. If not, nothing in .CSV File below will be referenced.\n* .CSV File: Upload the csv file for this run. The csv file will map which samples the pipette will visit the bottom of the tube. Wells marked with X will be aspirated from the Sample Aspiration Height parameter (see below). Otherwise, wells marked with O (capital letter O, not zero) will be aspirated from the bottom of the tube. Refer to the csv sample below.\n\n* Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples (1-81) for this run.\n* Tip Withdrawal Speed: Specify the tip withdrawal speed for the tip to leave the urine samples.\n* Sample Aspiration Height (mm):  Specify the sample aspiration height (in mm) from the bottom of the urine samples to aspirate from. Any well marked X in the csv, if uploaded will use this height. If the csv is not uploaded, all urine samples will use this height.\n* Sample Aspiration Height (mm): Specify the dispense height from the bottom of the 96 well plate to dispense sample. \n* P300 Multi-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 single channel pipette.\n",
