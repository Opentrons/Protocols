    "description": "This protocol automates the transfer of rehydration buffer, samples, positive control, and negative control from the CerTest VIASURE SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection kit into a PCR plate. It requires a 96 deep well plate of samples (1-94), the positive and negative control tubes in a tube rack, and a new PCR plate. This protocol uses exactly 2 tip racks and takes advantage of manually programmed multichannel transfers so that it only requires a p20 multichannel pipette. \n\n\n\nOpentrons P20-multi channel electronic pipette (GEN2)\nOpentrons 20ul Filter Tips\nNEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL\nNEST 0.1 mL 96-Well PCR Plate, Full Skirt\nVIASURE SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit\n",
