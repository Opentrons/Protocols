    "description": "This protocol isolates nucleic acid using a MagBio CTL lysis buffer and MAG-S1 particle beads suspended in 100% isopropanol. 200\u00b5L of sample is pre-loaded into each well within a Kingfisher deep-well plate on the Opentrons magnetic module. The sample undergoes extraction with 2 ethanol washes. The eluate is then transferred to a full-skirted PCR plate along with PCR master-mix for further processing.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.15.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nP20 Single Pipette\nP300 Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 20 \u00b5L\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 \u00b5L\nOpentrons NEST 96 well plate 100ul PCR full skirt\nOpentrons NEST 12-Well Reservoir\nOpentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set (24-tube insert)\n\n\n\nFor this protocol, be sure that the pipettes (P20 and P300) are attached.\nUsing the customization fields below, set up your protocol.\n Number of columns: Specify the number of columns of samples loaded onto the NEST deep well plate.
