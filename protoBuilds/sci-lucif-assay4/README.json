    "description": "The protocol performs liquid handling for reporter cell lysis and luciferase-catalyzed chemical reaction in a 96-well plate, ready for bioluminescence measurement by a microplate reader.\nThe luciferase reporter assay is used to investigate the regulation of expression of a gene of interest. This method relies on reporter cells created by stable or transient transfection of a promoter-driven, luciferase-expressing DNA. The bioluminescence proportional to luciferase expression can be quantified to assess the functional connection between the expression of the target gene which is controlled by this promoter, and the factor to be studied which may exhibit a regulatory effect on the cell behaviors at the transcription level. In this particular example, HeLa cells are stably or transiently transfected with an NF-kB promoter-driven, luciferase reporter construct, treated with an NF-kB activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and activation of NF-kB assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity.\nReagent preparation:\nThe luciferase assay kit purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) contains all reagents for cell lysis and luminescent signal development. To prepare luciferase assay reagent, the lyophilized luciferase assay substrate is dissolved in luciferase assay buffer per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cell culture lysis reagent (5X) provided in the assay kit is diluted to working concentration. For a full 96-well plate, 11 mL luciferase assay reagent (100 uL per sample) and 4.6 mL lysis reagent (30 uL per sample) are recommended. These 2 reagents and PBS for washing (50 uL per sample, 6.5 mL sufficient for 96 samples) are filled in a NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL.",
