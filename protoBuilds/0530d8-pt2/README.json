A field for aspiration height when transferring the samples from the heater shaker to the magnetic module allows the user to ensure beads are not picked up, and and aspiration rate of 10% of the default is instilled to ensure so. Note: for reagent 4 in columns 4 & 5, reagent 5 in columns 6 & 7, and reagent 6 in columns 8 & 9, split the total calculated reagent volume EQUALLY between the pair of columns, as the protocol will circle between the pair of columns as the source.\n",
