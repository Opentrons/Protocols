    "description": "This protocol automates the ThermoFischer MagMAX Plant DNA Isolation Kit on up to 96 samples. The entire workflow is broken into 2 different protocols. This is part 2, DNA purification.\n\nIn this protocol, 25\u00b5L of magnetic beads plus 400\u00b5L of ethanol is added to 400\u00b5L of sample (from part 1). After off-deck mixing, the plate is returned to the OT-2 for supernatant removal. This process continues with wash buffer 1, wash buffer 2, and the elution buffer. However, the supernatant of the elution buffer is preserved in a 96-well PCR plate and can be used for further downstream application.\n\n\nUpdate April 26, 2021: The addition of magnetic beads has been made optional.\n\nUpdate May 3, 2021: A second wash step has been added and heights of aspiration adjusted.\n\nUpdate June 8, 2021: Added the ability to park tips. This will cut down on tip usage when using 48+ samples.\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.21.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module, GEN2\nOpentrons p300 Multi-Channel Pipette (attached to right mount)\nOpentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 96-Well Deep Well Plate\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nMagMAX\u2122 Plant DNA Isolation Kit\nSamples\n\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 11: NEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL (for liquid waste)\n\nSlot 4: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\n A1: Magnetic Beads (see note 1 below)\n A2: Ethanol (Samples 1-32)\n A3: Ethanol (Samples 33-64)\n A4: Ethanol (Samples 65-96)\n A5: empty\n A6: empty\n A7: empty\n A8: empty\n A9: empty\n A10: Wash Buffer 1 (Samples 1-32)\n A11: Wash Buffer 1 (Samples 33-64)\n A12: Wash Buffer 1 (Samples 65-96)\nSlot 5: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\n A1: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 1-32)\n A2: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 33-64)\n A3: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 65-96)\n A4: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 1-32)\n A5: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 33-64)\n A6: Wash Buffer 2 (Samples 65-96)\n A7: empty\n A8: empty\n A9: empty\n A10: empty\n A11: Elution Buffer (Samples 1-48)\n A12: Elution Buffer (Samples 49-96)\nSlot 10: Labware Containing Magnetic Beads (see note 1 below)\n\nSlot 7: Opentrons Magnetic Module, GEN2 with NEST 96-Well Deep Well Plate containing Samples\n\nSlot 1: NEST 96-Well PCR Plate\n\nSlot 8: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (see note 2 below)\n\nSlot 9: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (see note 2 below)\n\nSlot 6: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (see note 2 below)\n\nSlot 3: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (see note 2 below)\n\n\nSlot 2: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (see note 2 below)\n\n\nNote 1: If using, the Magnetic Beads can be placed in well 1 of the NEST 12-Well Reservoir (in slot 4) or in column 1 of a different piece of labware (in slot 10)\nNote 2: Ten (10) columns of tips are needed per column of sample and will be accessed in the following order: slot 8, 9, 6, 3, 2.
