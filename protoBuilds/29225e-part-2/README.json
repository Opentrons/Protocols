Alternatively, when the p20 single is not selected by the user, pause and prompt the user to perform manual transfers of water. Volumes and destination wells are provided in a displayed pause comment viewable in the OT app.\n2. Use the p300 single to distribute master mixes (up to 19 uL) to wells of the PCR plate according to the uploaded transfers csv file.\n3.
