Any well to the left of a forward slash (/) will correspond to the well in the reservoir containing the desired target cell. Any well to the right of a forward slash (/) will correspond to the effector cell in the 96 well plate for part 2 of this protocol. If a cell is only to receive one of the effector or target cells, place a 0 (e.g. A1/0 would mean target cell from A1 of the reservoir with no effector cell). All cells that are to be skipped (receive neither effector nor target cell) should have a lowercase 'x' in the resepective cell in the .csv file. For the parameters below, make sure there are NO commas inside of the wells, and just the values. For the mount, put nothing else but \"left\" or \"right\". For the pre-mix variable, you must start the well with \"Yes\" or \"No\", but can put anything else after that (e.g. \"Yes premix\", or \"No premix\").\n Transfer Volume Target Cell: Specify the volume (in ul) to transfer between target cells in reservoir to well plate.\n Pre-mix before aspirating in source reservoir?: Specify whether or not to pre-mix before each transfer of target cell in reservoir to plate.\n Pre-mix height in reservoir: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the height in the reservoir wells in which to pre-mix.\n Pre-mix repetitions: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the number of repetitions to mix before each transfer.\n Pre-mix Volume: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the pre-mix volume (in ul).\n Pre-mix Rate: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the mix rate. A value of 1 is default mix speed, whereas a value of 0.5 is half of the default mix speed, etc.\n Dispense Reservoir Height: Specify the height above the reservoir bottom to dispense residual solution.\n Transfer Aspiration Height: Specify the height in which to aspirate from in the reservoir. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.\n Transfer Dispense Height: Specify the height in which to dispense from in the well plate. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.\n Aspiration Rate: Specify the aspiration rate for transfers.
