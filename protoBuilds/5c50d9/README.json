If the number of samples selected exceeds the number of samples that can fit onto the deck, the protocol pauses and prompts the user to refill the tube racks with new samples up to the number of samples selected. Afterwards, 4ul of the resulting solution is transferred to the final 384 well plate.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples: Select the number of samples (1-384) for this run. If larger than 90 samples are selected, the protocol will pause after the last sample is transferred on the deck and will prompt the user to refill samples up to the number specified. Samples should always be placed in the tuberack down by column, and in the order of the deck slots (i.e. 4, 5, 6 ..., etc.)\n P20/P300 Dispense Flow Rate: Global control of P20 and P300 dispense flow rate.
