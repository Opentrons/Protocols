    "description": "This protocol is designed for testing calibration of the OT-2 with a custom tube holder, holding 500\u00b5L tubes from Simport Scientific, with Opentrons Tips. This protocol can be used for testing the P300 Single Channel Pipette or the P300 Multi Channel Pipette.\nIf testing the P300 Single Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5\u00b5L from A1 to A2, A3, and A4 with a 200\u00b5L filter tip. The robot will then make transfers with 200\u00b5L filter tips, first 50\u00b5L from B1 to B2, B3, and B4; then 200\u00b5L from C1, to C2, C3, and C4.\nIf testing the P300 Multi Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5\u00b5L from column 1 to column 2, 3, and 4 with 200\u00b5L filter tips. The robot will then make transfers with 200\u00b5L filter tips, first 50\u00b5L from column 5 to column 6, 7, and 8; then 200\u00b5L from column 9 to column 10, 11, and 12.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.15.0 or later)\nP300 Single Channel Pipette\nP300 Multi Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tips\nSimport Scientific 500\u00b5L Tubes in Custom Holder\n\n\n\nFor this protocol, be sure that the correct pipette (P300 Single or Multi) is attached for the intended test case.\nLabware Setup\nSlot 1: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tips\nSlot 3: Simport Scientific 500\u00b5L Tubes in Custom Holder\nUsing the customization fields below, set up your protocol.\n Pipette Type: Select either Single Channel or Multi Channel.
