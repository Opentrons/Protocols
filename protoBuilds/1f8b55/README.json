    "description": "This protocol automates spotting of slides, using a custom labware piece that holds 4 slides, each containing 21 spots.\n\nThe protocol begins by adding 1\u00b5L to each spot of the four slides, using solutions in A2, A3, A4, and A5 of a 1.5mL eppendorf tube in an Opentrons Tube Rack in slot 2 (changes tip between each solution).\n\nThe protocol concludes by adding 1\u00b5L of solution to each spot of the slides in triplicate. Cycling through tubes A6 of the tuberack in slot 2 and tubes in A1-A6 in slot 3, the p20 will make each transfer and discard tip after each transfer.
