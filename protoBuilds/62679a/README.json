Each compound's dilution will occupy a column of a 96-well plate, requiring up to 4x 96-well plates for a full 48-compound dilution protocol. Stock compound will be transferred to row A of the dilution plates, and a 6-step dilution will be carried down the plate through rows B-G. Well H of that column will contain pure DMSO. A P300 or P20 pipette is automatically selected for each compound's dilution, depending on the dilution factor, and thus, the transfer volume.\nThe input file for the workflow should be specified in a format similar to this template.\n",
