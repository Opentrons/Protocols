    "description": "This protocol preps a 96 well plate with cell culture and a variety of reagents. First, the protocol parses the csv to check for wells which have a confluency value of greater than 85. These values will be referenced and added to for the duration of the protocol. If there are a group of confluency wells with a value of greater than 85 in a single column, the multi-channel pipette will be used, only picking up the number of tips necessary. The user may be asked to replace tips if the protocol runs out. Note that a volume of at least 3mL of any reagent should be in each reservoir well AFTER the protocol is completed (i.e. there should never be > 3mL of reagent at any point of the protocol). See protocol steps below for details.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n csv file: Upload the csv file as so:\nWell,Confluency\nA1, 90\nB1, 83\n Temperature module temperature (C): Specify temperature module temperatre in celsius\n First step aspiration rate (moving to waste): Specify the aspiration rate in step 1 of the protocol when included wells are moved to waste, where 1.0 is default, 1.5 is 50% faster, and 0.2 is 20% default speed, for example.\n PBS Dispense Flow Rate: The PBS will be dispesed into the plate 2mm from the side of the well to avoid separation of culture. Specify the flow rate, where 1.0 is default, 1.5 is 50% faster, and 0.2 is 20% default speed, for example.\n Incubation Time (minutes): Specify the incubation time i nminutes after trypsin is added to the plate.\n Media Aspirate X (ul): Specify volume of media to move from column 12 of the reservoir to the plate.\n Media Dispense Y (ul): Specify the volume of the second media to be added to the plate.\n Track tips?: Yes for tracking tips, no for fresh tip boxes.\n*  P300 Single-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host your P300 pipettes.\n",
