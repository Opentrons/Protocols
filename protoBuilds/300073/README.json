    "description": "This protocol transfers saliva samples from 25 mL tubes to a 96 well plate. The samples are located in 6 4-in-4 tube racks on the left side of the deck. Optionally a second set of tube racks can replace the first one if more than 45 samples need to be distributed. Optionally the target plate can be placed on a temperature module with an aluminum block.\nThe destination plate is divided into four quadrants and the samples are distributed in a zig zag pattern from top left - top right - bottom left - bottom right (see below). Samples are not transferred to the three first wells of the target plate because they contain control samples, symmetrically the first 3 tube slots in Sample set 1:Tuberack quadrant 1 contain no sample tubes.\nThe tubes in the tuberacks in slot 10, 11, 7 and 8 constitute the 1st tuberack quadrant, and should be regarded as a single unit (Tuberack quadrant 1) consisting of 4 rows of tubes with 12 columns. Samples are transferred in row order to quadrant 1 of the target plate for Sample set 1, and to quadrant 3 for Sample set 2.\nSimilarly the tuberacks in slot 4, 5, 1 and 2 constitute Tuberack quadrant 2.
