See the Roche/KAPA HyperPrep protocol for more information about sample input requirements.\n* \n\n\nPlate Moving\nThe Protocol requires manually transferring the sample plate between the Thermocycler and Magnet 3 times.  It starts on the Thermocycler and needs to be moved to the Magnet for the post-ligation cleanup, and then moved to the Thermocycler for PCR and then back to the Magnet for the post-PCR cleanup.  In the script the two positions are handled as sample_plate_mag and sample_plate_thermo; during calibration use an empty plate of the same labware as the sample plate on the magnet position to allow calibration.\n\n\nTip Tracking\nTip Tracking is an option meant to reuse tips for repeated washes.  Instead of discarding tips the OT2 will replace them in their original location for repeated use, this reduces the number of tips needed and allows a 24 sample run to require no tiprack replacements.  To prevent cross contamination when reusing Tips, when running the protocol with tip reuse, the reservoir is a 96x 2ml deepwell plate instead of a 12x well 15ml plate.  See Reservoir for more details.\n\n\n\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples: Specify number of samples 8, 16, or 24.\n Dry Run: Specify whether performing a dry run or not.\n Modules or no modules: YES or NO, 'YES' will not require modules on the deck and will skip module steps, for testing purposes, if DRY RUN is 'YES', then NO MODULES will automatically set itself to 'NO'\n Reuse tips: YES or NO, Reusing tips on wash steps reduces tips needed, no tip refill needed, suggested only for 24x run with all steps\n\nOffset: YES or NO, Sets whether to use protocol specific z offsets for each tip and labware or no offsets aside from defaults\nInclude ERAT: Steps with \"DECK\" are for reaction to take place with the on deck Thermocycler module. This arrangement makes it possibly to set up and run only the first half, or to skips steps and resume if there is an Error.\nInclude ERAT Deck step: If non \"DECK\" steps are skipped, then TIPREUSE will automatically set\nitself to 'NO' in order to keep tip order correct.\n\n",
