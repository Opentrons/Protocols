Quick mix before each aspiration as beads settle quickly.\nStep 2: Transfer 36ul beads to NEST 100ul full-skirt plate (PCR1) on the Magnetic Module. Mix 50ul 6x with new tips for each column.\nStep 3: After 2 min pause, engage magnet for bead separation.\nStep 4: With 200ul filter tips, aspirate out 60 ul supernatant from each well. (Park tips here). Dispense waste liquid to column 12 of reservoir.\nStep 5: With a new column of 200ul filter tips, add 80ul 80 percent EtOH (12-well reservoir) to each well. Use the same tips for whole plate. Dispense a few mm above well. Eject to trash.\nStep 6: With parked tips from step 4, aspirate out 85ul supernatant from each well. Dispense waste liquid to column 11 of reservoir. Park tips.\nStep 7: Repeat Steps 5 and 6. Parked tips can be ejected in waste now.\nStep 8: Delay 5 min to allow EtOH evaporation from beads.\nStep 9: Disengage magnet.\nStep 10: Add 43 ul H20 (from reservoir), into each well of PCR1 on the Magnetic Module. Mix 10x to suspend beads.\nStep 11: After 2 min incubation, engage magnet.\nStep 12: Transfer 40ul eluted DNA into a new 96-well plate (PCR2) in slot 1.\n\n---\n![Materials Needed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/materials.png)\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our [online store](https://shop.opentrons.com/) or contact our sales team at [info@opentrons.com](mailto:info@opentrons.com)\n\n* [Opentrons OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2)\n* [Opentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)](https://opentrons.com/ot-app/)\n* [Opentrons Multi-Channel p300 Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette)\n* [Opentrons Tips for the p300](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips)\n\n---\n![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)\n\n",
