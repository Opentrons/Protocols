    "description": "This protocol automates nucleic acid purification with the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Kit.\n\nUsing the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette and a Single-Channel Pipette, this protocol can accommodate up to 48 samples per run and can be configured to run any multiple of 8 up to 48. Starting with 400\u00b5L of sample in a deepwell plate, the entire process is automated and ends with 60\u00b5L of elution containing nucleic acid dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate. The elution is then ready for RT/qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, hybridization, etc.\n\nThis kit can be used for Station B (RNA extraction) of our COVID Workstation.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nOpentrons P300 Multi-Channel Pipette\n(5) Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tips\nOpentrons P20 (or P10) Single-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 10/20\u00b5L Filter Tips\nNEST 96-Deep Well Plate, 2mL\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir\nOpentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack\n1.5mL Centrifuge Tube\nZymo Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Kit\nSamples\n15mL Falcon Tube\n\n\n\nReagent Preparation\nPrepare all reagents according to Zymo manual.\n\n\n\n\nProteinase K: In 1.5mL centrifuge tube, placed in \"D1\" in Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack with 24-slot top.\nViral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads: In slots 1, 2, and 3 in the 12-well reservoir. For every column (8 samples), 7mL of Viral DNA/RNA Buffer should be combined with 175\u00b5L of MagBinding Beads. Up to two columns (16 samples) worth of buffer+beads can be prepared in one Falcon Tube at a time. Each slot of the 12 well reservoir can accommodate volume for 2 columns/16 samples and should be loaded sequentially (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 1 would get 14mL buffer + 350\u00b5L beads, slot 2 would get 7mL buffer + 175\u00b5L beads, slot 3 would be empty).\nMagBead DNA/RNA Wash 1: In slots 4 and 5 in the 12-well reservoir.

Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 6 would get 13.5mL, slot 7 would be empty).\nEthanol Wash 1: In slots 8 and 9 in the 12-well reservoir.

Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 8 would get 13.5mL, slot 9 would be empty).\nEthanol Wash 2: In slots 10 and 11 in the 12-well reservoir. Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 10 would get 13.5mL, slot 11 would be empty).\nNuclease-Free Water: In slot 12 in the 12-well reservoir. To accommodate 24 samples or less, 4mL of water should be used.
