    "description": "This protocol is part two of a three-part series to automate the Twist Library Prep protocol. See below for all three parts:\n\nPart 1: Fragmentation & Repair\nPart 2: Ligate Adapters\nPart 3: PCR Amplification\n\nThe final plate from part one should be run through the thermocycler program outlined in the Twist Library Prep protocol before being moved back to the OT-2 for this protocol.\n\nThis protocol begins by adding 5\u00b5L of the Twist Universal Adapters to each well containing samples from part one, followed by the addition of 45\u00b5L of Ligation Master Mix. The user is then prompted to remove plate and incubate the samples on a thermocycler. Following incubation, the user will return the plate to the OT-2 for a fully-automated magbead-based wash process (2 times) that will result in the 15\u00b5L of supernatant transferred to labware selected by the user. The user should then take the labware containing the supernatant and run on the thermocycler before moving to part three.\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons p20 (Single- or Multi-Channel) Pipette\nOpentrons p300 (Single- or Multi-Channel) Pipette\nOpentrons Tips\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nOptional, Opentrons Temperature Module, for active cooling during protocol\nMulti-Well Reservoir, such as the NEST 12-Well Reservoir or USA Scientific 12-Well Reservoir\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nOpentrons Tube Rack or Aluminum Block Set\nMicrocentrifuge Tube, 1.5mL or PCR strips\nSamples\nTwist Enzymatic Fragmentation and Twist Universal Adapter System\nOptional, Single-Well Reservoir, such as the NEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL or Agilent 1-Well Reservoir, 290mL, for liquid waste\n\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 1: Empty Destination PCR Labware (such as NEST 96-Well PCR Plate or PCR Strips in 96-Well Aluminum Block)\n\nSlot 2: Plate containing Twist Universal Adapters\n\nSlot 3: Opentrons Tips for P300\n\nSlot 4: Multi-Well Reservoir\nLayout for 12-well reservoir:\nA1: DNA Purification Beads (80\u00b5L per sample)\nA3: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 1, samples 1-48 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA4: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 1, samples 48-96 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA5: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 2, samples 1-48 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA6: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 2, samples 48-96 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA12: Elution solution (water, 10mM Tris-HCl pH, or Buffer EB) (17\u00b5L per sample)\nLayout for 4-well reservoir:\nA1: DNA Purification Beads (80\u00b5L per sample)\nA2: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 1, samples 1-96 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA3: Freshly prepared 80% ethanol for wash 2, samples 1-96 (200\u00b5L per sample)\nA4: Elution solution (water, 10mM Tris-HCl pH, or Buffer EB) (17\u00b5L per sample)\n\nSlot 5: Opentrons Tips for P20\n\nSlot 6: Opentrons Tips for P300\n\nSlot 7: Labware containing ligation master mix (on Opentrons Temperature Module, if active cooling during protocol)\n\nSlot 10: Opentrons Magnetic Module with plate from part one\n\nOptional, Slot 11: Single-Well Reservoir for liquid waste\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n P20 Type: Select the type (Single- or Multi-Channel) to use; P20 should should be mounted on the left mount\n P300 Type: Select the type (Single- or Multi-Channel) to use; P300 should should be mounted on the right mount\n Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples to run (1-96)\n Type of MagDeck: Select which generation (1, 2) magnetic module to use\n Plate on MagDeck: Select which labware type contains samples and is placed on magnetic module\n Module (for cooling): Select whether or not an Opentrons module will be used for active cooling during protocol\n Destination Plate: Select the labware that will be used for the elutions\n Reservor for Reagents: Select which reservoir will be used for reagents\n Sample Plate: Select the labware that will contain the gDNA samples\n Master Mix Labware: Select the labware that will contain the ligation master mix\n* Liquid Waste Destination: Select where liquid waste should be disposed of\n\n",
