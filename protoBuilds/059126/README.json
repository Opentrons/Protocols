    "description": "This is a specialized reagent addition to add reagent from vials in a Cytiva well plate to a 96 well plate which are then transferred to a 384 well plate. The tips are picked up in a non-standard manner with a single tip picked up from the bottom-right corner to add from the vials to the 96 well plate. The columns of the 96 well plate will then have a specified amount of each column added to the 384 well plate, reusing tips as much as possible.\nSample numbers should be specified in multiple of 16 for most efficient reagent use. I.e. 2 samples can be specified but reagent will be added to all of column 1 in the 384 well plate. 32 samples will add reagent to column 1 and 2 in the 384 well plate.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples in 384 Well Plate: How many samples will be in the 384 well plate\n Transfer Volume (1-20uL): How much liquid will be transferred from the 96 well plate to the 384 well plate in uL. Please keep in mind the max volume of 50uL for the 384 well plate when specifying number of vials and transfer volume along with the liquid handling in the script. I.e. During the 384 well addition, a blow-out followed by a tip touch will occur 1 mm below the well top to ensure no liquid remains in the tip or beads on the tip.\n Number of Vials (1-12): How many starting vials are there in the Cytiva well plate. Each vial will fill a single column in the 96 well plate. A1 goes to column 1, B1 to column 2, C1 to column 3, etc.\nP20 Multi GEN2 Mount: Which mount the P20 multi-channel is connected to.
