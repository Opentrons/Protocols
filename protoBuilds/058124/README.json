    "description": "This protocol uses a multi-channel P300 and single-channel P20 pipette to perform custom serial dilution of up to 48 input protein samples. There are six dilution schemes (defined below) which differ in diluent volume, sample volume, number of mix repeats, fold dilution and number of dilution points. An input csv file assigns a dilution scheme and a sample number to each sample (sample numbers 1-48 in column-wise order spanning two 24-tube racks). Samples using the same dilution scheme are assigned (up to 8 at a time) to a block of four consecutive dilution plate columns. The p300 will pick up a number of tips corresponding to the current number of samples (up to 8) and fill two to four dilution plate columns (depending on the assigned dilution scheme) with dilution buffer. The p20 will add sample to the filled wells of the first column. The p300 will then perform serial dilution steps (mixing and transfer to the next column). User-specified parameters are available to indicate the labware to be used for the diluent reservoir, and the necessary amount of deadvolume (small amount of inaccessible liquid in the bottom of the reservoir) for that reservoir. A downloadable output file (see instructions below) will be generated which indicates the dilution plate destination well for each input sample.\nLinks:\n* example input csv\n\n\n\n",
