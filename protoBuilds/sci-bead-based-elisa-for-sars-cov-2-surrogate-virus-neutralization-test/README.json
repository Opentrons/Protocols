    "description": "ACROBiosystems SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-coupled Magnetic Beads (Cat. #: MBS-K002, Newark, DE, USA) are streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads attached with biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD protein. Using RBD protein as the target antigen for neutralizing antibodies to bind, a bead-based ELISA is developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples. \nThe protocol performs mixing and incubation of the RBD-conjugated magnetic beads with serum samples to enable specific binding of the RBD and neutralizing antibodies. The Magnetic Module renders magnetic separation of the beads from unbound molecules in the samples, which are removed by washing. Then, an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody is added. This antibody binds to neutralizing antibodies which are immobilized on the beads through the interaction with RBD. The complex formed on the beads is a typical format of a sandwich ELISA (antibody-antigen-antibody) which after another round of washes, can be exposed to a substrate of HRP to generate a photometric signal that can be measured on a microplate reader at 450 nm.\nReagents:\n1.  SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-coupled Magnetic Beads (ACROBiosystems, Cat. #: MBS-K002, Newark, DE, USA)\n2.  Mouse Monoclonal Anti-Human IgG Fc (HRP) (Abcam, Cat. #: ab99759, Cambridge, UK)\n3.

Heater Shaker Module (GEN1) with Aluminum Adaptor for 96-well Deep Well Plate\n3.  Magnetic Moddule (GEN2)\nDeck setup:\nPlease see the deck layout as the general guideline for labware setup. \n1.  The Heater Shaker Module is loaded at Slot 3. \n2.  Samples or sample dilutions are pre-loaded in a NEST 96 Deep Well Plate 2mL (the working plate) placed on the Magnetic Module (Slot 9)\n3.  The REAGENTS plate (Slot 11) is filled with bead suspension in Column 1, Anti-Human IgG Antibody in Column 2, TMB Substrate Solution in Column 3, and Stop Solution in Column 4\nNote: See Reagent Setup for reagent plate preparation\n4.  For WASH (Slot 5), sufficient wash buffer is filled in each well for 6 washes of 250 \u03bcL.\n5.  Three boxes of Opentrons 96 tips (Slot 3, 4, and 10) are sufficient to run a full plate of 96 samples.\n6.  The WASTE plate is loaded at Slot 6.\n7.  A Corning 96 Well Plate 360 \u00b5L Flat (the FINAL plate) is loaded at Slot 7.",
