Using the purified nucleic acid samples from Station B (RNA Extraction), the samples are then aliquoted and mixed with the reaction mix of the assay as outlined in our article on automating Covid-19 testing.\n\nUsing a Single-Channel Pipette, this protocol will begin by transferring reaction mix (combination of master mix and primers/probes) from a 1.5mL tube in the 24-well aluminum block to the specified wells of a plate for qPCR. Then, using the Single-Channel Pipette or optional Multi-Channel Pipette, samples will be transferred from their plate to the qPCR plate and mixed with the reaction mix.\n\nThis protocol uses a custom labware definition.
