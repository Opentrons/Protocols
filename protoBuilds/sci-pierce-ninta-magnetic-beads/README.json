    "description": "This protocol (Part 1) performs pipetting and mixing of reagents and samples on the OT2 as the first part of automated process of His-tagged protein purification using Pierce Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads.\nThe user can determine the number of samples to be processed, and if desired, a second elution step can be performed to increase recovery.\nThe sample containing His-tagged protein (target protein) and Ni-NTA magnetic beads (beads) will be transferred to and mixed in a 96-well deepwell working plate on the OT2. The first part of the protocol completes at this point allowing the user to move the working plate to an agitation device, a beads/target protein incubation period determined by the user. After incubation, the process proceeds with the second part of the protocol on the OT2. Beads/target protein complex will be washed, and target protein eluted for further analysis.\nLinks:\n* Opentrons Protocol part-1: Pierce NiNTA Magnetic Beads\n\nOpentrons Protocol part-2: Pierce NiNTA Magnetic Beads: part-2\n\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nThermo Fisher Pierce Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads\n\nEquilibration buffer (Equilibration buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4)\n\n\nOpentrons OT-2\n\n\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\n\n\nMagnetic Module GEN2\n\n\nNEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom\n\nNEST 1-Well Reservoirs, 195 mL\nNEST 12-Well Reservoirs, 15 mL\n4-in-1 Tube Rack Set\n\nNEST 15 mL Centrifuge Tube\n\n\nOpentrons 300\u00b5L Tips\n\n\nP300 Single-Channel GEN2\n\nP300 8-Channel GEN2\n\n\n",
