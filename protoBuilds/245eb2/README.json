    "description": "This protocol automates a nucleic acid extraction using the Opentrons Magnetic Module and incorporates the Axygen 300\u00b5L plate (holding samples and elutes).\n\nThis protocol begins with 20\u00b5L of sample in the Axygen plate and 20\u00b5L of magnetic beads are added and mixed. After removing the supernatant, there are two subsequent washes with ethanol (150\u00b5L per sample). Finally, 50\u00b5L of elution buffer is added to the sample wells and after incubation, the elution is transferred to a second Axygen plate.\n\nBetween 1 and 96 samples can be processed with this protocol using the GEN2 p300 Multi-Channel Pipette. Because the 8-channel pipette is used, the protocol will behave as if a multiple of eight is used (ex. if you select 10 samples, the protocol will behave in the same way as if you selected 16 samples) - please plan reagent consumption accordingly.\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nOpentrons p300 Multi-Channel Pipette, GEN2\nOpentrons Tips\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL\nAxygen 300\u00b5L Plate\nReagents (magnetic beads, ethanol, elution buffer)\nSamples\n\n\n\nThe Opentrons Magnetic Module should be placed in slot 6 with an Axygen plate containing samples on top.\n\nThe NEST 12-Well Reservoir should be placed in slot 5 with the following reagnets:\n Magnetic Beads: Slot 8\n Ethanol (for wash 1): slot 6 (for samples 1-48), slot 5 (for 48+ samples)\n Ethanol (for wash 2): slot 4 (for samples 1-48), slot 3 (for 48+ samples)\n Elution Buffer: slot 1\n\n\nThe NEST 1-Well Reservoir should be placed in slot 9 for liquid waste.\n\nAn empty Axygen plate should be placed in slot 3, for elutes.\n\nThe Opentrons Tiprack(s) will be accessed in the following order: slot 1, slot 2, slot 4, slot 7, slot 10, slot 11.
