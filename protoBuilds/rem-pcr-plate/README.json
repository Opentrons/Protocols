NB the subsequent troughs will be used for the following plates so they also need to be free. Make sure\nthat Number of Plates is not greater than the number of available troughs, if so use a new reservoir plate.\n Volume to dispense (uL): Typically 9 (without DNA in mix) or 10 (with DNA in mix).\n* Touch Tip on the...: Which side should the tip touch the well on (the opposite side to which you touched the tip\nwhen adding the DNA (if applicable)) \n",
