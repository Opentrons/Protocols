Continue to keep the HEPA filter turned on during the duration of setting up the robot with the respective labware, dilutions of the drug (thapsigargin)on the second day and addition of the drug on to the 96 well plate\n1.\tTake a 24\u201348 hours old T-75 flask of A549 cells. Take a cell count using the automated Countess 3 machine (Thermofisher Scientific) after treating the cells with Tryple Express enzyme and dislodging the adherent cells.\n2.\t8000 cells are to be seeded in each well of the 96 well plate. Adjust the cell volume in 10% Ham\u2019s F12K medium in such a way that 60 microL of cells contain the cell number mentioned above.\n3.\tThe cell suspension was then dispensed in ten 1.5mL snap-capped tubes and placed in Slot 6 in the tube rack(225microL).\n4.\tThe medium was added in wells A5 to C5 as negative control \n5.\tOn the second day, roughly after 12 to 16 hours of seeding, the drug dilutions and additions are completed.\n6.\tThe first tube A1 in Slot 7 contains 35microL of 1mM Thapsigargin.\n7.\tNext, prepare dilutions of various concentrations of thapsigargin in 10% Ham\u2019s F12K medium (4X concentrations) after preparing the initial stocks ranging from 10nM to 100microM. The molar concentrations of stocks in tubes in positions are - A1 1mM, A2 100microM, A3 10microM, A4 1microM, A5 100nM, A6 50nM and B1 10nM.\n8.\tThe 4X concentrations of thapsigargin are prepared in tubes C1 to C6 and D1 to D6 with the following concentrations in the tubes C1 1.56nM, C2 3.12nM, C3 6.24nM, C4 12.52nM, C5 25nM, C6 50nM, D1 100nM, D2 200nM, D3 400nM, D4 800nM D5 1600nM and D6 2000nM\n9.\tFor both the initial stocks and the 4X working concentrations, the Ham\u2019s F12 K diluent in added to respective tubes.
