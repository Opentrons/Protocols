    "description": "This protocol serially dilutes stock from the stock tube rack (slot 4) to up to 15 tubes in the dilution rack (see diagram below). Volume, tube source, tube destination, and slot source/destination are all read by the robot to perform all transfer steps. 2 mix steps are also included at half tube depth to avoid pipette submersion. The user can specify any number of tube racks (15 or 24) in the csv, and the protocol will accommodate.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n csv: Import a csv file with the following format (you do not need to specify mix steps). Note that volumes should be in mL. Also note that unless calling the reservoir, an initial tube volume should be placed for all tubes.\n\n Number of tipracks: Specify how many tipracks of each type below. For 1000ul tipracks, tipracks should be placed in order of slots 6, 9, and 11. For 20ul tipracks, tipracks should be placed in order of slots 8 then 10. For volumes less than 100ul, the P20 pipette will be used. For all volumes greater than 100ul, the P1000 pipette will be used.\n Aspirate/dispense/blowout rate: A value of 1 returns a defualt rate for both pipettes. A value of 1.5 is 50% faster than the default for both pipette, 0.33 is 1/3 of the default rate, etc.\n P1000/P20 Single-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P1000 and P20 single-channel pipettes.\n",
