Load tubes into the tube rack. Place H2O (~500ul) into tube A1, fresh 70% ethanol (~600ul) into tube A2, and Tris-HCl with NaCl into tube A3. Place empty tubes in B2 and B3 - these will be used as liquid trash and as intermediate locations for samples. Also place an empty tube in C1 - this will be your output tube.\n3. Load the rest of the deck as the protocol asks and press go. No intervention should be necessary, and you can take out your prepared library from tube C1 in the tube rack after the protocol finishes.\n\n",
