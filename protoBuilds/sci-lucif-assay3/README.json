    "description": "The protocol performs liquid handling to apply test articles (e.g., serial dilutions of drug candidates) to the reporter cells cultured in a 96-well plate.\nThe luciferase reporter assay is used to investigate the regulation of expression of a gene of interest. This method relies on reporter cells created by stable or transient transfection of a promoter-driven, luciferase-expressing DNA. The bioluminescence proportional to luciferase expression can be quantified to assess the functional connection between the expression of the target gene which is controlled by this promoter, and the factor to be studied which may exhibit a regulatory effect on the cell behaviors at the transcription level. In this particular example, HeLa cells are stably or transiently transfected with an NF-kB promoter-driven, luciferase reporter construct, treated with an NF-kB activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and activation of NF-kB assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity.\nReagent preparation:\nPBS used for washing (50 uL per sample, 6.5 mL sufficient for 96 samples) is filled in the first well of a NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL. Test articles are diluted in DMEM at the concentrations of interest and pre-loaded in a Corning 96 Well Plate 360 \u00b5L Flat (150 uL per well).",
