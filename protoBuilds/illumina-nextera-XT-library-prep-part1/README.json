The library amplification step increases the yield of the tagmented DNA using PCR. PCR adds the Index 1 (i7), Index 2 (i5), and full adapter sequences to the tagmented DNA from the previous step. This protocol assumes you are taking your plate off the OT-2 and thermocycling on a stand-alone PCR machine according to the Illumina Reference Guide. \nAfter the two steps carried out in this protocol, you can safely stop work and return to it at a later point.
