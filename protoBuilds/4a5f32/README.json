Move to channel 1 of reagent plate in position 5\n4. Aspirate 20ul beads in channel 1 - 3mm from bottom, mix (150ul vol, 2 times), air gap 20ul\n5. Dispense beads into A1-H1 of sample plate on the magnetic module \u2013 2mm above top of well, blow out to destination well\n6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to dispense beads in entire plate\n7. Drop tips to waste\n8. Pause for 5 mins - \u20185 Min incubation to allow bead binding\u2019\n9. Engage magnet 10mm\n10. Pause for 3 mins - \u20183 min incubation to allow beads to move to magnet\u2019\n\nRemoval of supernatant\n\n11. Pick up tips A1-H1 \u2013 position 2\n12. Aspirate 40ul of supernatant from A1-H1 of sample plate on magnetic module \u2013 2mm from bottom, slow speed\n13. Dispense into the middle of waste trough in position 1 - 10mm from bottom, blow out to destination well\n14. Eject tips back into same position of tip box in position 2\n15. Repeat steps 11 to 14 to remove waste from the whole plate using the corresponding tips for each column\n\nEthanol Washes\n\n16. Pick up tips A2-H2 \u2013 position 7\n17. Move to channel 3 of reagent plate in position 5\n18. Aspirate 100ul \u2013 3mm from bottom, air gap 20ul\n19. Dispense to column A1-H1 of sample plate on the magnetic module \u2013 2mm above well top, blow out to destination well\n20. Repeat steps 18-19 to add liquid to all wells\n21. Drop tips to waste\n22. Pause for 30 secs - \u2018Incubate for 30 seconds at RT\u2019\n23. Pick up tips A1-H1 \u2013 position 2\n24. Aspirate 100ul of wash buffer from A1-H1 of sample plate on magnetic module \u2013 2mm from bottom, slow speed\n25. Dispense into the middle of waste trough in position 1 - 10mm from bottom, blow out to destination well\n26. Eject tips back into same position of tip box in position 2\n27. Repeat steps 23 to 26 to remove waste from the whole plate using the corresponding tips for each column\n28. Pick up tips A3-H3 \u2013 position 7\n29. Move to channel 4 of reagent plate in position 5\n30. Repeat steps 18 to 27 so that two complete ethanol washes have been carried out\n\nElution Stage\n\n31. Pause for 10 mins \u2013 \u2018Air dry the pellet for 10mins at RT\u2019\n32. Disengage the magnet\n33. Pick up tips A4-H4 \u2013 position 7\n34. Move to channel 5 of reagent plate in position 5\n35. Aspirate 20ul \u2013 3mm from bottom\n36. Dispense into column A1-H1 of sample plate on the magnetic module \u2013 3mm from bottom, mix 10ul vol, 5 times, blow out destination well\n37. Drop tips to waste\n38. Repeat steps 33 to 37 to add elution buffer to entire plate\n39. Pause for 10 mins \u2013 \u2018Incubate at RT for 10 mins to elute the sample off the beads\u2019\n40. Engage magnet\n41. Pause for 2 mins- \u2018Incubate at RT for 2 mins to allow beads to move to magnet\u2019\n42. Pick up tips A4-H4 \u2013 position 8\n43. Aspirate 20ul from A1-H1 of sample plate on the magnetic module \u2013 1mm from bottom\n44. Dispense 20ul into A1-H1 of elution plate in position 3, blow out destination well\n45.
