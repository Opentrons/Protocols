{"title": "Basic Liquid Transfer for Multiple Aliquots", "author": "Opentrons", "categories": {"Basic Pipetting": ["Distribution"]}, "description": "This protocol performs a transfer of culture supernatant aliquots from 24-well deep well plates into 96-tube racks of matrix tubes. The protocol allows for user input of number of samples, number of aliquots per sample, and volume of each aliquot transfer. The quantity of each labware necessitated by the specified number of samples and aliquots is automatically calculated and prompts the user to load the proper quantities upon launching in the Run App. The protocol can also handle deck refills if the specified number of samples and aliquots cannot be accommodated with one full 11-slot deck setup.\nEach sample is iterated down each column and then across each row. If more than 24 samples are specified, the 25th sample is taken from the first well of the second deep well plate, and the transfers continue. Similarly, the destinations of the aliquots are oriented down each column and then across each row, before moving to the next destination tube rack. Aliquots of the same sample use the same tip and are filled vertically adjacent to each other on the 96-tube racks.\n\nYou will need:\n ThermoFisher Matrix 1mL Tubes\n Axygen 24-Deep-well Plate\n P1000 Single-Channel Electronic Pipette\n Opentrons 1000uL Tips", "robot": ["OT-2"], "process": "\nDownload your protocol with desired number of samples, number of aliquots per sample, and volume of each aliquot transfer.\nUpload your protocol into the OT App.\nSet up your deck according to the deck map.\nCalibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support article.\nHit \"Run\".\nFor each sample, the specified volume of sample is distributed to as many tubes in the destination rack as aliquots per sample specified.
