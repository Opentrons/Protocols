The protocol will alert the user to ensure reagents are present on deck in sufficient volume.\n3. The protocol will prompt the user to manually add 10-120 ng total RNA in 7 uL to dried-in sample-barcode RT primer in 8-96 wells of the index plate in slot 8, mix to dissolve the primer, incubate 3 minutes 85 degrees C, cool to 25 degrees C, spin and return the plate to slot 8.\n4. The p20 single and p300 single are used to assemble a reverse transcription mastermix and add 3 uL of it to each filled well in the index plate.\n5. After a 15 minute, off-deck incubation at 42 degrees C, reactions are pooled into one or two wells (if more than 56 samples) of the magnetic module plate followed by a bead cleanup.\n6. Eluates are combined into a single pool and treated with RNA removal solution followed by second-strand synthesis and a second bead cleanup.\n7. The p20 single will assemble and add PCR mastermix.\n8. The protocol will pause for off-deck PCR library amplification followed by a final bead cleanup.\n\n",
