    "description": "This protocol automates filling plates that have been turned 90-degrees on the deck. Using custom adapters, the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette is used to transfer a set volume (selected below) from a Beckman Coulter 8-Channel Reservoir to a Simport 96-Well Plate (on an adapter that allows the plate to be turned 90-degrees). The P300 Multi-Channel pipette picks up tips from an Opentrons Tip Rack (also on an adapter), by picking up 8/12 tips from the column (liquid transfer happens to 8/12 wells in column on plates) and then the last 4 tips in the column (for last 4/12 wells in columns on plates).\n\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.21.0 or later)\nOpentrons P300 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN2)\nOpentrons 300\u00b5L Tip Rack\n(2x) Simport 96-Well Plate, 1200\u00b5L\nBeckman Coulter 8-Channel Reservoir, 19mL\nReagents\n\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 2/5: Simport 96-Well Plate, in adapter (Plate 1)\n\nSlot 8/11: Simport 96-Well Plate, in adapter (Plate 1)\n\nSlot 4/7: Opentrons 300\u00b5L Tip Rack (in adapter)\n\nSlot 10: Beckman Coulter 8-Channel Reservoir with Reagents\n\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n P300-Multi Mount: Select which mount (left or right) the P300-Multi is attached to.\n Transfer Volume (\u00b5L): Specify the volume (in \u00b5L) that should be transferred to each well.\n* Number of Columns to Fill (1-8): Specify the number of columns to fill in each plate.",
