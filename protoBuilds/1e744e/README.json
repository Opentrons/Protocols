The input viral RNA samples for this protocol (up to four elution plates output from part-1) were prepared using:\n* [automated OT-2 protocol from the Opentrons Protocol Library - Mag-Bind\u00ae Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/sci-omegabiotek-magbind)\n* [reagent kit - Omega Mag-Bind\u00ae Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit - 12 x](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-reagents/products/omega-mag-bind-viral-dna-rna-96-kit-12-x-96-preps)\n\nSet up: Be sure to use the left USB port to connect the Temperature Module located in deck slot 1. Be sure to use the right USB port to connect the Temperature Module located in deck slot 3. Precool both temperature modules to 4 degrees C by using settings in the OT app prior to running this protocol. Place up to four sample plates (96-well elution plates from the step 1 - extraction of viral RNA) in deck slots 2, 4, 5, 6 (in that order). Place the mastermix plate (with one column already filled for each full plate of 96 input samples, so there would be four columns filled for 384 input samples - 180 uL mastermix per well if mastermix transfer volume is 15 uL, 120 uL per well if 10 uL). Place the 96-well or 384-well reaction plate on the appropriate aluminum block on the Temperature Module in deck slot 3. Place Opentrons 20 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_20ul in deck slots 7-11.\n\nThe OT-2 will perform the following steps:\n1. Use the p20 multi to distribute mastermix (15 uL per well by default, optionally 10 uL per well) to the reaction plate (either 96-well or 384-well format) according to the number of input viral RNA samples specified.\n5. Use the p20 multi to transfer (5 uL per well) input viral RNA sample to columns of the reaction plate.\n\n---\n![Materials Needed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/materials.png)\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our [online store](https://shop.opentrons.com/) or contact our sales team at [info@opentrons.com](mailto:info@opentrons.com)\n\n* [Opentrons OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2)\n* [Opentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)](https://opentrons.com/ot-app/)\n* [Opentrons p20 Multi-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette)\n* [Opentrons Filter Tips for the p20 Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips)\n* [BioGX XFree Mastermix](https://www.biogx.com/xfree/)\n* [384-well Aluminum Block]()\n\n---\n![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)\n\n",
