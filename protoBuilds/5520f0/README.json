It performs various washes with PBS, 4% PFA, Perm Buffer, including Primary and Secondary Antibody solutions. The protocol utilizes various reservoirs and keeps track of reagent and waste volumes.\nExplanation of parameters below:\n\nP300 Multi GEN2 Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P300 multi channel pipette.\nNumber of Plates: Total number of plates being run (Max: 6). Please follow the placement order in the deck layout below.\nNew Tip per Plate: Everytime a plate is completed, you can either use a new tip (Always) or continue using the same tip (Never).\nDispense Flow Rate: The flow rate in uL/s as liquid is dispensed throughout the protocol. The default dispense rate of a P300 Multichannel is 94 uL/s.\nAspiration Height from Well Bottom: The dispensing height from the bottom of the well in (mm). A value of 0.5 means, 0.5 mm from the very bottom of the well.\n\n",
