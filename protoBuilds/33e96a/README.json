    "description": "This protocol preps up to 12 columns of samples for PCR/qPCR. Reagent A is first added to the plate up the specified number of columns, then samples are reformatted from four tube racks to a 96 well plate on the magnetic module. The four tube racks exactly mirror the 96 well plate, and transfers are done one-to-one between the tube rack and plate by column (A1-D1 of tube racks on slot 4 then 1, A2-D2 of tube racks on slot 4 then 1, so on and so forth). Samples are then mixed, magnet engaged, and supernatant removed. After incubation period, reagent B is added, and the process is repeated through reagent C.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Columns: Specify the number of columns on the magnetic plate to process.\n Incubation Time: Specify the incubation time in minutes\n P300 Single Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 single-channel pipette\n P300 Multi-Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 multi-channel pipette\n",
