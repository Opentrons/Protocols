    "description": "This protocol performs a custom sample normalization from a source plate to a second plate, diluting with water from a reservoir. Sample and diluent volumes are specified via .csv file in the following format, including the header line (empty lines ignored):\nSource/destination plate well, Description, Concentration, Sample (\u00b5l)\nnA01, 13377_16S_Bac, 3.28, 12.52\nThe protocol performs the following operations:\n1. Transfers 40 \u00b5L of water to each well of the destination plate using the p300\n2. Removes x \u00b5L of water from the well and adds x \u00b5L of DNA sample according to the line in the CSV.\n3. Mixes the samples 3 times.\nUpdate (Jan 28, 2022): This protocol has been updated.
