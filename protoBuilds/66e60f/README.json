    "description": "This protocol performs a custom sample normalization from one or two source plate(s) to one or two final plate(s), diluting with water from a 12 well reservoir on slot 11 based on an input csv file. After normalization the protocol samples 5 \u00b5L from each well from the final plate(s) and dispenses it into a DNA pool tube on the tuberack on slot 5 (the tube in position A2). Sample and diluent volumes are specified via the .csv file in the following format, including the header line (empty lines ignored, also note that this is just an example and that any number of lines less than and up to 2x96 may be specified):\nPlate, Well, SampleID, Concentration, VolumeToDispense\nA, A1, Sample1, 3.28, 12.52,\n...\nA, H12, Sample96, 5.30, 9.70,\nB, A1,  Sample97, 6.34, 8.60,\n...\nB, H12,  Sample192, 7.34, 5.60,\nThe plate is either A (to Final plate slot 6 from DNA plate slot 9) or B (to Final plate slot 4 from DNA plate slot 7)\nUpdate (Jan 28, 2022): This protocol has been updated. The user can now select between the Opentrons P300 GEN2 Single-Channel pipette or the Opentrons P300 GEN2 8-Channel pipette.\nParameters:\n .csv input file: Input file (see above)\n Source plate type: Opentrons compatible 96 well plate containing DNA samples\n Destination plate type: Opentrons compatible 96 well plates where DNA samples are diluted with water\n Tuberack/tubes: Tuberack/tube combination for DNA and water bins and DNA pool.\n P300 type: Single or multichannel: Only used for the initial water distribution\n Air gap volume: Volume of air for all air gaps, default is 10 \u00b5L\n\n",
