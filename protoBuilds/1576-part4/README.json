This particular section is part 4 of the series, which is performed to ensure that sufficient library yield is available for the following targeted enrichment procedure.\nBefore you start, review the protocol guide to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables. Follow the instructions to set up the appropriate thermocycler program. See 'Additional Notes' below for reagent setup.\nThere is a pause during the protocol, you need to immediately transfer the PCR plate to the pre-heated thermocycler (98\u00b0C) and skip to the next step in the program. While the program is executing, you can set up the next part of the protocol by following the instructions on the App and resume the protocol immediately once the thermocycler program finishes.\nOnce the protocol completes, it is safe to stop the workflow and return to it at a later point. If you are stopping, store the amplified libraries at 4\u00b0C overnight or at -20\u00b0C for long term storage.\n---\nYou will need:\n\nOpentrons P50 Multi-channel Pipette\nOpentrons P300 Single-channel Pipette\nOpentrons 300 uL Tipracks\n12-row Trough\nBiorad Hard-Shell 96-well PCR Plates\nOpentrons Aluminum Block Set\nOpentrons Temperature Module\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nCell3\u2122 Target: Library Preparation kit\n", "robot": ["OT-2"], "process": "\nDownload your protocol.\nUpload your protocol into the OT App.\nSet up your deck according to the deck map.\nCalibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support article.\nHit \"Run\".\n", "notes": "Reagent Setup:\n\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please contact protocols@opentrons.com.", "internal": "Lcy03lF7\n1576", "markdown": {"title": "Cell3\u2122 Target Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment for NGS Part 4: Library Amplification", "author": "[Opentrons](http://www.opentrons.com/)\n\n", "categories": "* NGS Library Prep\n    * Cell3\u2122 Target\n\n", "description": "Links:\n* [Part 1: Fragmentation / End-repair / A-tailing](./1576-part1)\n* [Part 2: Ligation of Illumina UMI adapters](./1576-part2)\n* [Part 3: Clean-up of adapter ligated library](./1576-part3)\n* [Part 4: Library Amplification](./1576-part4)\n* [Part 5: Library Pooling](./1576-part5)\n* [Part 6: Probe Hybridization](./1576-part6)\n* [Part 7: Probe Capture on Streptavidin Beads and Washes](./1576-part7)\n* [Part 8: Captured Library Amplification and Clean-up](./1576-part8)\n\n---\n---\n\nThis protocol performs the workflow of Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment as described in the [NONACUS Cell3\u2122 Target Protocol Guide v1.2.2](https://nonacus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell3Target_Protocol_v1.2.2.pdf).
