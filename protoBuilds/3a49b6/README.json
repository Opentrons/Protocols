Place the 96-well plate containing initial RNA samples (added to the plate in A1-A12, B1-B12, C1-C12 order) on the temperature module (slot 3).\n\nThe OT-2 will perform the following steps:\n\n1. A custom volume of water (listed in the csv file) is dispensed to the wells of the destination plate using a single channel p20.\n\n2. A custom volume of RNA (listed in the csv file) is dispensed to the wells of the destination plate using a single channel p20. When listed RNA volumes are less than 2 ul, an intermediate 5X dilution of the RNA is used (3 ul RNA + 12 ul water in a temporary plate) and then a 5-fold larger volume of this dilution is transferred to the destination plate (with a corresponding reduction in Vol H2O). The dilution and destination plates are mixed after each dispense of RNA.\n\n---\n![Materials Needed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/materials.png)\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our [online store](https://shop.opentrons.com/) or contact our sales team at [info@opentrons.com](mailto:info@opentrons.com)\n\n* [Opentrons OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2)\n* [Opentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)](https://opentrons.com/ot-app/)\n* [Opentrons Single-Channel p20 Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette)\n* [Opentrons Tips for the p20](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips)\n\n---\n![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)\n\n",
