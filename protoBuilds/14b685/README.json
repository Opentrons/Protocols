    "description": "This protocol automates the PCR Clean-Up step of the Illumnia 16S kit with a slight modification to volumes.\n\nBeginning with a starting volume of sample (input by user), 20\u00b5L of AMPure XP beads is added to each well. After incubation on the Magnetic Module, the supernatant is removed and two ethanol wash steps occur (with 195\u00b5L added to each well). Finally, 30\u00b5L of 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 or molecular grade water is added to each well and after incubation, 25\u00b5L of supernatant is transferred to a clean PCR plate.\n\nThis protocol requires an Opentrons Magnetic Module and the GEN2 P300 and P20 8-Channel Pipettes, in addition to the Illumina 16S kit and labware (more information below).\n\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.21.0 or later)\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nOpentrons P300 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN2)\nOpentrons P20 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN2)\nOpentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack(s)\nOpentrons 20\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nSamples\nReagents (AMPure XP beads, 80% Ethanol, and 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 or molecular grade water)\n\n\n\nThis protocol utilizes a variable number of 200\u00b5L filter tips, depending on the number of samples input (below).

Given this, if running 8 samples, only the first 6 columns of tips in slot 8 would be used. Additionally, tips used for adding ethanol are used again to remove supernatant. Finally, tips used after the addition of beads and removal of first supernatant, are replaced in empty slots/tipracks for easier disposal and to prevent waste bin from getting too full.\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 1: NEST 96-Well PCR Plate (clean and empty for elutes)\n\nSlot 2: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 5)\n\nSlot 3: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 6)\n\nSlot 4: Opentrons 20\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack\n\nSlot 5: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 3)\n\nSlot 6: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 4)\n\nSlot 7: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL (for reagents)\nA1: AMPure XP beads (20\u00b5L per sample)\nA2: 80% Ethanol, wash 1, samples 1-48 (195\u00b5L per sample)\nA3: 80% Ethanol, wash 1, samples 49-96 (195\u00b5L per sample)\nA4: 80% Ethanol, wash 2, samples 1-48 (195\u00b5L per sample)\nA5: 80% Ethanol, wash 2, samples 49-96 (195\u00b5L per sample)\nA6: 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 or molecular grade water (30\u00b5L per sample)\n\nSlot 8: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 1)\n\nSlot 9: Opentrons 200\u00b5L Filter Tip Rack (Rack 2)\n\nSlot 10: Opentrons Magnetic Module with NEST 96-Well PCR Plate containing samples\n\nSlot 11: NEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL (for liquid waste)\n",
