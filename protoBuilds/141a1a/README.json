    "description": "This protocol automates the cell-free gene expression test as outlined by users at TU Munich. See below:\n\nThis protocol sets up a cell-free gene expression experiment (TXTL test) in a 384-well plate. A TXTL sample is composed of cell extract (E), buffer (B), and a plasmid coding for the desired genes. The cell extract and buffer volume in each sample is fixed, the volume of plasmid in each sample depends on the plasmid stock concentration and the desired sample concentration of the plasmid. The final volume of 15\u00b5l is reached by adding nuclease-free water to the sample.\n\nWith the parameters, the user is able to test separate samples for different plasmids coding for the fluorescent proteins (ex. RFP, YFP, GFP and CFP) and measure up to 3 replicates for each of them. In addition, up to two blank samples containing E+B and water are made. First, mastermixes of plasmid and water are made, then distributed to the corresponding wells in the 384-well plate. Then E+B mixes are prepared and also distributed to the corresponding wells.\n\nThis protocol uses a custom labware definition for the Brand 384-well plate. When downloading the protocol, the labware definition (a JSON file) will be included for use with this protocol. For more information on using custom labware on the OT-2, please see this article: Using labware in your protocols\n\nIn the case that the protocol needs more tips than can be accommodated, the robot will pause, flash the rail lights, and ask the user to replace the tiprack.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons Thermocycler Module\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons P300 (GEN2) Single-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons P20 (GEN2) Single-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 300\u00b5L Tips\nOpentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\n(2) Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set, with 24-well top\n1.5mL Centrifuge Tubes\n2mL Centrifuge Tubes\n96-Well Aluminum Block\nPCR Strips\nBrand 384-Well Plate\nReagents\n\n\n\nSlot 1: Brand 384-Well Plate\nSlot 2: Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set, with 24-well top with 1.5mL Centrifuge Tubes (for Cell Extracts + Buffer)\nSlot 3: 96-Well Aluminum Block with PCR Strips (containing Buffer aliquots)\nSlot 5: Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set, with 24-well top with 2mL Centrifuge Tubes (for Plasmid stock and Nuclease-Free Water)\n A1: Plasmid 1 Stock (RFP)\n B1: Plasmid 2 Stock (YFP)\n C1: Plasmid 3 Stock (GFP)\n D1: Plasmid 4 Stock (CFP)\n A3: (Empty) Plasmid 1 Master Mix\n B3: (Empty) Plasmid 2 Master Mix\n C3: (Empty) Plasmid 3 Master Mix\n D3: (Empty) Plasmid 4 Master Mix\n A5: Nuclease-Free Water\n D5: (Empty) Pooled Buffer\nSlot 6: Opentrons 20\u00b5L Tips\nSlot 9: Opentrons 300\u00b5L Tips\nSlot 7/8/10/11: Opentrons Thermocycler Module\n\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n Plasmid Mix CSV: Upload a CSV containing headers (plasmid, molecular weight, concentration, and sample concentration).\n Number of Replicates (1-3): The number of replicates per plasmid.\n Number of Cell Extracts (1-24): The number of cell extracts (each extract will be dispensed in a column (1-24)).\n Number of Blanks per Cell Extract (1, 2): The number of blanks (no plasmid) per cell extract (either 1 or 2).\n P20 Mount: Select which mount (left or right) the P20 Single is attached to.\n P300 Mount: Select which mount (left or right) the P300 Single is attached to.",
