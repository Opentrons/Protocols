The protocol will transfer 20\u00b5L to the destination plate and repeat the process, up to three times, at the 1, 2, and 4 day mark.\n* Labware Containing Samples: Select the type of tube that will be used to contain the samples. This tube should be place in the 24-Well Aluminum Block.\n* Temperature Module: Select which generation of the Temperature Module will be used.\n* Reset Tipracks?: This protocol can save the state of the tipracks after each run for the P300 and the P20. If this is set to \"Yes\" (or the protocol is run for the first time on the robot), the protocol will begin picking up tips from the A1 of Tiprack 1 for each pipette. If set to \"No\", the saved tip state from the previous run will be accessed and the pipette will begin using tips where the previous protocol run left off. The user will be prompted to replace the corresponding tip racks.\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 1: Destination Plate (NEST 96-Well PCR Plates) - 20\u00b5L of sample aliquots will be transferred here.
