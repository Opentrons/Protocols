    "description": "The human Fibronectin (FN) EIA kit (Cat. #: MK115, Takara Bio, San Jose, CA, USA) is an in vitro assay kit for quantitative determination of soluble human FN in serum, urine, cell culture supernatants, and other biological fluids. The assay utilizes two mouse monoclonal anti-human FN antibodies allowing an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich to form: the capture antibody pre-coated on 8-well strips, and the detection antibody conjugated with peroxidase (POD). The photometric signal can be developed by exposing this complex to a substrate of peroxidase, with the absorbance proportional to the amount of target (i.e., human FN) present in the sample.\nThe protocol performs transferring of the samples into the EIA plate to allow the capture antibody to bind to FN. After washing, the detection antibody is added into the EIA plate. After another round of washing, the substrate for POD is transferred into the EIA plate to develop photometric signal which can be measured on a microplate reader at 450 nm. The on-deck Heater-Shaker Module provides set temperature at 37\u00b0C for sample incubation to promote antigen-antibody interaction.\nMaterials provided in the kit:\n1.  Anti-human FN monoclonal antibody coated microtiter plate (8-well strip x12)\n2.  POD-labeled anti-human FN monoclonal antibody (Antibody-POD Conjugate)\n3.  Lyophilized human FN (for standards)\n4.  Sample Diluent\n5.  Substrate Solution (TMBZ)\nOther materials required:\n1.  Wash and Stop Solution for ELISA (Takara Bio, San Jose, CA, USA)\n2.  Slit seal (BioChromato, Fujisawa, Japan)\n3.  NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL \n4.  NEST 96 Deep Well Plate 2mL\n5.  Opentrons Tip Rack, 300 \u00b5L\n6.  Nunc 96-Well Polypropylene Storage Microplates (Cat. #: 249947, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) or compatible \n7.  Microplate Reader\nPipettes and Modules\n1.  Opentrons P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)\n2.  Heater Shaker Module (GEN1) with Aluminum Adaptor for 96-well Flat Plate\nDeck setup:\nPlease see the deck layout as the general guideline for labware setup. \n1.  The EIA plate is sealed with a slit seal and placed on the Heater Shaker Module (Slot 3). \n2.  Samples or sample dilutions are pre-loaded in the Nunc 96-Well Polypropylene Storage Microplates, the SAMPLES plate (Slot 1).\n3.  The REAGENTS plate (Slot 4) is filled with Antibody-POD Conjugate in Column 1, Substrate Solution in Column 2, and Stop Solution in Column 3.\nNote: see Reagent Step for reagent plate preparation\n4.  For WASH1 (Slot 5), sufficient wash buffer is filled in each well for 3 washes of 250 \u03bcL, and 4 washes for WASH2 (Slot 8)\n5.  Three boxes of Opentrons 96 tips (Slot 7, 10, and 11) are sufficient to run a full 96-well EIA plate (12 8-well strips).\n6.  The WASTE plate is loaded at Slot 9.",
