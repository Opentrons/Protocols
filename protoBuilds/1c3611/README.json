For efficiency, the mastermixes will first be plated from their source tubes into distribution columns using a single channel pipette, before being loaded into the 384-well plate with an 8-channel pipette.\nFor sample traceability, an output .csv file will be written to the robot's Jupyter notebook server for each protocol run.
