This particular section is part 6 of the series, which hybridizes the library pool with DNA biotin-labelled probes, to enrich for the targeted region of interest.\nBefore you start, review the protocol guide to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables. Follow the instructions to set up the appropriate thermocycler program. See 'Additional Notes' below for reagent setup.\nAfter the protocol completes, place the Bio-rad Hardshell plate in the pre-heated thermocycler (95\u00b0C) and skip to the next step in the program. Leave the hybridization reaction mix at 65\u00b0C on the thermocycler to incubate for 4 hours.\n---\nYou will need:\n\nOpentrons P50 Single-channel Pipette\nOpentrons P10 Single-channel Pipette\nOpentrons 10 uL Tipracks\nOpentrons 300 uL Tipracks\nBiorad Hard-Shell 96-well PCR Plates\nOpentrons Aluminum Block Set\nOpentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set\nOpentrons Temperature Module\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nCell3\u2122 Target: Library Preparation kit\n", "robot": ["OT-2"], "process": "\nDownload your protocol.\nUpload your protocol into the OT App.\nSet up your deck according to the deck map.\nCalibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support article.\nHit \"Run\".\n", "notes": "Reagent Setup:\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please contact protocols@opentrons.com.", "internal": "Lcy03lF7\n1576", "markdown": {"title": "Cell3\u2122 Target Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment for NGS Part 6: Probe Hybridization", "author": "[Opentrons](http://www.opentrons.com/)\n\n", "categories": "* NGS Library Prep\n    * Cell3\u2122 Target\n\n", "description": "Links:\n* [Part 1: Fragmentation / End-repair / A-tailing](./1576-part1)\n* [Part 2: Ligation of Illumina UMI adapters](./1576-part2)\n* [Part 3: Clean-up of adapter ligated library](./1576-part3)\n* [Part 4: Library Amplification](./1576-part4)\n* [Part 5: Library Pooling](./1576-part5)\n* [Part 6: Probe Hybridization](./1576-part6)\n* [Part 7: Probe Capture on Streptavidin Beads and Washes](./1576-part7)\n* [Part 8: Captured Library Amplification and Clean-up](./1576-part8)\n---\n---\n\nThis protocol performs the workflow of Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment as described in the [NONACUS Cell3\u2122 Target Protocol Guide v1.2.2](https://nonacus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell3Target_Protocol_v1.2.2.pdf).
