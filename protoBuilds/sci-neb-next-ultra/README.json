    "description": "This protocol automates the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae on the OT-2.\nThis protocol was developed internally by Opentrons for use on the OT-2 and provides several options. Users can select how many samples to prepare, whether or not to use on-deck modules (like our thermocycler), and whether or not to perform certain steps in the process. Additionally, users can select to enable a \"Test Mode\" that is great for performing a dry run of the protocol.\nFor a more detailed explanation of this protocol, including deck setup and reagent setup, please see this guide: link to guide\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples: Select the number of samples to prepare\n Test Mode (dry run): Select whether to perform a dry run (Yes) instead of a sample run\n Use Modules: Select whether or not you are using our Magnetic Module (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) and Temperature Module (GEN2)\n Reuse Tips: Select whether or not to reuse tips for certain steps (selecting yes will reuse tips in a sterile way, saving on the amount of tips used and eliminating the need to replace tips during the run)\n Use Thermocycler: Select whether or not you will use our on-deck GEN1 thermocycler module. If not using (select \"No\"), the user will be prompted to move the sample plate to an off-deck thermocycler.\n Use Opentrons Offsets: Select whether to use Z offsets used by the Opentrons Science Team (\"Yes\") or use the default Z heights of the labware (\"No\")\n Perform ERAT Step: Select whether or not to perform the ERAT step.\n Perform Ligation Step: Select whether or not to perform the Ligation step.\n Perform Post-Ligation Step: Select whether or not to perform the Post-Ligtion step.\n Perform PCR Step: Select whether or not to perform the PCR step.\n* Perform Post-PCR Step: Select whether or not to perform the Post-PCR step.\n",
