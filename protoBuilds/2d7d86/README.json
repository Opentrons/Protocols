    "description": "This protocols preps a 384 plate for qPCR processing. 1-14 samples can be selected. If running less than 14 samples, the protocol will pick up the correct number of tips (less than 8) to dispense across all columns in the 384 well plate. Tips are exchanged per source column in the 96 well plate.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* Number of Samples (1-14): Specify the number of samples for this run. Note: for sample numbers less than 14, place samples in order down the column beginning from column 1, with positive and negative controls always in A1 and A2, respectively. For example, patient sample 4 should be in E1, patient sample 7 should be in H1, and patient sample 8 should be in B2. If running 8 samples, the multi-channel pipette will only pick up two tips when accessing column 2 of the source plate.\n* P20 Multi-Channel Pipette Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 Multi-Channel pipette.\n",
