    "description": "This protocol automates the transfer of PCR mix and samples from up to four 96-well elution plates to a 384-well plate. It follows a specific format detailed in the image below. Columns from the 96 well elution plates correspond to specific wells on the 384 well plate. Each elution plate contains a control that is also transferred into the 384-well plate. For runs that have less than four plates, the controls will need to be added manually for the corresponding elution plate.
