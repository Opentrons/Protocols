    "description": "This protocol performs viral titration (serial dilution) of viral samples. It adds media to the dilution plates and then begins the serial dilution process of up to 12 columns worth of samples. It will dilute the samples in one of four dilution plates and then add it to the analysis dish in a specific order (skipping 3 columns for every dilution).\n\n\n\nOpentrons 200uL Filter Tips\nCorning 96 Well Round Bottom 1mL\nCorning 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplate\nNEST 1 Well 195mL Reservoir\nP300 Multichannel GEN2\n\nFor more detailed information on compatible labware, please visit our Labware Library.\n\n\nNote: The Dilution Plates utilize the Corning 96 Well Round Bottom 1mL and the Analysis Dishes utilize the Corning 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplate.\n\nLabware Type\n Dilution Plate: Corning 96 Well Round Bottom 1mL\n Analysis Dish: Corning 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplate\n Samples: NEST 96 Well Plate 100uL PCR Full Skirt\n Media Reservoir: NEST 1 Well 195mL Reservoir\nProtocol Steps\n1.
