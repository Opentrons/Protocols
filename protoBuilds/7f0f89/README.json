The developer solution is aspirated from a Nest 195mL reservoir, then distributed to the 216-well plate down by column. Transfers are distributed in chunks of 3 between the reservoir and plate, with a delay and blow out step for viscous liquid considerations. Extra developer solution is aspirated to ensure that each cartridge receives adequate distribution.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons P300 Single-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 96 Tip Rack 300 \u00b5L\nOpentrons 300\u00b5L Tips\nNest 1-Well Reservoir 195 mL\nInvoy 216-Well Cartridge Plate\nInvoy Canisters with Fibrous Reservoir\n\n\n\nSlots 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11: Invoy 216-Well Cartridge Plate\nSlot 6: Opentrons 96 Tip Rack 300 \u00b5L\nSlot 9: Nest 1-Well Reservoir 195 mL\n\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples in your protocol run.\n Dispense Height Above Cartridge: Specify the height (mm) above the cartridge the pipette will dispense liquid\n Dispense Volume: Specify the volume (\u00b5L) of developer solution dispensed into each cartridge\n Dispense Flow Rate: Specify the rate (\u00b5L/sec) at which the pipette will aspirate solution into each cartridge\n Dispense Flow Rate: Specify the rate (\u00b5L/sec) at which the pipette will dispense solution into each cartridge\n Aspirate Delay Time: Specify the time to delay after each aspiration (in seconds)\n Dispense Delay Time: Specify the time to delay after each dispense (in seconds)\n P300 Single GEN2 Mount: Specify the mount side for the P300 Single GEN2 pipette",
