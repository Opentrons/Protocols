Samples are drawn from the tube rack by column (A1, B1, C1...H1, A2...etc.) and dispensed to the well plate in the same order. The pipette will dispense, and then blowout after dispensing into the well plate. The user has the ability to manipulate the number of samples per run. \nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples (1-96) for this run.\n* P300 Single-Channel Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300-single channel pipette.\n",
