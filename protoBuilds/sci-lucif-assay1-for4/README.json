    "description": "The protocol performs liquid handling to prepare up to four 96-well plates of mammalian cells for luciferase reporter assay.\nThe luciferase reporter assay is used to investigate the regulation of expression of a gene of interest. This method relies on reporter cells created by stable or transient transfection of a promoter-driven, luciferase-expressing DNA. The bioluminescence proportional to luciferase expression can be quantified to assess the functional connection between the expression of the target gene which is controlled by this promoter, and the factor to be studied which may exhibit a regulatory effect on the cell behaviors at the transcription level. In this particular example, HeLa cells are stably or transiently transfected with an NF-kB promoter-driven, luciferase reporter construct, treated with an NF-kB activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and activation of NF-kB assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity.\nCell suspension preparation:\nMammalian cervical cancer cell line HeLa (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or HeLa-originated cell line with a sequence of NF-kB response element upstream of luciferase-expressing DNA integrated in the cell\u2019s genome (Cellomics Technology, Halethorpe, MD, USA) is maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. HeLa cells are detached by using trypsin, resuspend in DMEM and poured into a NEST 12-well reservoir. To prepare one 96-well plate cell culture, for the assay that requires transient transfection to prepare reporter cells, resuspend 1/4 of cells collected from a confluent 100 mm tissue culture dish (~ 2.2 x 106 cells) in 11 mL DMEM. For the assay using the pre-engineered cell line stably expressing luciferase reporter, resuspend 1/2 of cells collected from a confluent 100 mm tissue culture dish (~ 4.4 x 106 cells) in 11 mL DMEM.",
