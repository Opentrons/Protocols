The pipette transfers the specified volume of target cell to a 384 well-plate to the parsed wells by multi-dispensing as much as the pipette tip can accommodate before returning to the reservoir. New tips are awarded between each target cell.\nNote: Part 1 and Part 2 should receive the exact same .csv file.\nFind part two of the protocol (effector cell loading) below:\nPart 2 - Effector Cell Loading\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n .CSV File: Upload the .csv file according to the template shown here. Any well to the left of a forward slash (/) will correspond to the well in the reservoir containing the desired target cell. Any well to the right of a forward slash (/) will correspond to the effector cell in the 96 well plate for part 2 of this protocol. If a cell is only to receive one of the effector or target cells, place a 0 (e.g. A1/0 would mean target cell from A1 of the reservoir with no effector cell). All cells that are to be skipped (receive neither effector nor target cell) should have a lowercase 'x' in the resepective cell in the .csv file. For the parameters below, make sure there are NO commas inside of the wells, and just the values.\n Transfer Volume Effector Cell: Specify the volume (in ul) to transfer between effector cells in reservoir to well plate.\n Pre-mix before aspirating in source well plate?: Specify whether or not to pre-mix before each transfer of target cell in reservoir to plate.\n Pre-mix height in well plate: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the height in the reservoir wells in which to pre-mix.\n Pre-mix repetitions: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the number of repetitions to mix before each transfer.\n Pre-mix Volume: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the pre-mix volume (in ul).\n Pre-mix Rate: If Pre-mix variable is set to Yes, specify the mix rate. A value of 1 is default mix speed, whereas a value of 0.5 is half of the default mix speed, etc.\n Dispense Reservoir Height: Specify the height above the reservoir bottom to dispense residual solution.\n Transfer Aspiration/Dispense Height: Specify the height in which to aspirate/dispense from in the well plate. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.\n Transfer Dispense Height: Specify the height in which to dispense from in the well plate. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.\n Aspiration Rate: Specify the aspiration rate for transfers. A value of 1 is default aspiration speed, whereas a value of 0.5 is half of the default aspiration speed, etc.\n Dispense Rate: Specify the dispense rate for transfers. A value of 1 is default dispense speed, whereas a value of 0.5 is half of the default dispense speed, etc.\n* P300 Multi-Channel Mount: Specify whether the P300 Multi-Channel pipette is on the left or right mount.\n",
