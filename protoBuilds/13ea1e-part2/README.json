    "description": "This protocol preps a 384 well sample plate with mastermix. Up to four plates can be loaded onto the deck with a no template control and human sample control in wells A1 and B1, respectively. Sample plates are transferred to the 384 well plate skipping wells down a column, as well as skipping columns (e.g. plate 1 to A1, C1, E1....H1, A3, C3, E3...etc). A positive control is added to the last well in the 384 well plate.\nThe protocol is broken down into 3 main parts:\n Mastermix made and distributed to 384 well plate.\n Sample added to 384 well plate.\n* Positive control added to plate.\nNote: For all transfers between tubes to well plate, transfers will always iterate over all tubes in the source. For example, mastermix will be transferred from tube C1 to plate, C2 to plate, C3 to plate, C4 to plate, C5 to plate, C6 to plate, C1 to plate, etc. Consequently, all reagent volumes should be split equally into respective tubes as seen in the deck layout.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of samples: Specify the number of samples (1-96) that the sample block, elution buffer block, ethanol block, NPW3 block, and NPW4 block will be filled.\n P20 Single Channel Mount (GEN2): Specify which mount the P20 Single Channel pipette will be mounted.\n Percent overage: Specify the overage percent to which mastermix will be made and distributed to the 384 well plate.\n Mix repetitions: Specify the number of mix repetitions for making mastermix, as well as after distributing sample to the mastermix.\n* P300 Multi Channel Mount (GEN2): Specify which mount the P300 Multi Channel pipette will be mounted.\n",
