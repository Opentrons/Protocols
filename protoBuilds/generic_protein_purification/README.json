    "description": "The generic protein purification is a flexible protocol that starts from bacterial\nmedia ready for lysis on a well plate. From there the protocol adds lysis buffer\nand then proceeds to bind the target his-tagged proteins with nickel linked paramagnetic beads. After a variable amount of washes the user may choose to\nelute the proteins using elution buffer, or with SDS buffer if the purpose is to\nrun the samples on a gel.\nThe user is given extensive control of the protocol from the parameters. Pipettes, labware, modules (i.e. temperature and magnetic modules), protocol steps, and volumes are examples of things that can be customized to the users specifications.\nThe protocol is based on Promega's MagneHis\u2122 system, but should work for any other similar system.\nParameters\n\nMagnet engagment time for bead binding How long to engage magnets in order to attract the beads before doing any pipetting steps\nNumber of samples How many bacterial media samples there are on the sample plate\nSmall pipette The smaller pipette, can be a multi-channel or single\nLarge pipetteThe larger pipette, can be a multi-channel or single\nSmall pipette tip-racks Tips to use with the small pipette\nLarge pipette tip-racks Tips to use with the large pipette\nReagent reservoir 12 well reservoir for reagents: Lysis buffer, NaCl (optional), Wash buffer, elution buffer, SDS buffer (optional), paramegnetic beads.\nDestination plate Plate where eluted proteins are transferred after adding elution or SDS buffer\nSample plate Plate containing wells with bacterial media\nMagnetic module Which magnetic module to use for the bead binding steps\nTube rack (optional) Tube rack for DNAse I (well 1) if used.\nDestination plate temperature module (optional) A temperature module for controlling the temperature of the destination plate\nPause robot operation to allow user to vortex magnetic beads?

Bacterial lysis: Lysis buffer is added to all the sample wells. If the DNAse step is activated DNAse will be added to each well as well (see parameter options below).

The protocol is paused to allow the user to shake the sample plate for 10-20 minutes at room temperature for the lysis reaction to complete\n3. Binding: The paramagnetic beads are added to the samples, along with sodium chloride, if desired. The user has an option to pause the protocol before this step in order to vortex the beads in order to resuspend them. The user may also specify a number of mixes with the pipettes to help homogenize the solution.\n4. The beads are washed with wash buffer (and optionally NaCl) and the supernatant is removed while the magnets on the magnetic module are engaged. This is repeated as many times as the user wants.\n5.
