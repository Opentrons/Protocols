It aims to provide sufficient flexibility in terms of sample and replicate numbers to avoid the need of multiple similar protocols.\nKey benefits of the protocol are:\n The master mixes will be prepared in 50 ml falcons and all reagents and samples can be provided in 1.5 ml tubes.\n Thus, no manual pipetting steps are involved.\n Up to 12 different template samples can be used with up to 3 different master mixes.\n Only the p300 and p20 pipettes are needed.\n* Needed volumes of the different reagents are calculated and shown in run tab.\nNotes:\n A no-template control (NTC) will be automatically added for each master mix.\n The first well of every master mix will always be in row A. If the sample number + NTC is not a multiple of 8, the remaining wells of the last column will be left empty to have an easier plate layout.\n* (e.g. You have 2 master mixes, 4 samples and 1 replicate each. The last well of master mix 1 will be E1 (NTC control). Master mix 2 will now be added to the wells A2 - E2, skipping the remaining wells of column 1.
