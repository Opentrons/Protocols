The five protocols are:\n\nProtocol 1: Seeding Plates with Mammalian Cells\nProtocol 2: DAPI Staining\nProtocol 3: Fix and DAPI Stain\nProtocol 4: Media Exchange\nProtocol 5: Primary Staining\n\nThe protocol begins with an empty reservoir for liquid waste, a 12-channel reservoir that contains what will be added to the plates, tips, eppendorf plate(s), and the P300-Multi attached to the left mount. Using up to 8 plates, the protocol will iterate through each plate and remove 50\u00b5L before adding 140\u00b5L from the reservoir. Each plate should have a designated well in the 12-well trough (i.e., slot 1 --> plate 1, slot 2 --> plate 2, etc.)\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons p300 Multi-Channel Pipette, GEN2\nOpentrons Tips\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL\nEppendorf Plate\nReagents\n\n\n\nSlot 1: Opentrons Tips, note: protocol saves tip state and will prompt user to replace tips when new tips are needed.\n\nSlot 2: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 1)\n\nSlot 3: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 2)\n\nSlot 4: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 3)\n\nSlot 5: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 4)\n\nSlot 6: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 5)\n\nSlot 7: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 6)\n\nSlot 8: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 7)\n\nSlot 9: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 8)\n\nSlot 10: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\n\nSlot 11: NEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL, for liquid waste\n\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n Number of Plates: Specify the number of plates (1-8) to use.\n Aspiration/Dispense Speed: Specify the aspiration/dispense speed of the pipette (in \u00b5L/sec).
