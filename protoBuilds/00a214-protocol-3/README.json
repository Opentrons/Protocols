    "description": "This protocol automates DAPI staining and is part of a five protocol suite. The five protocols are:\n\nProtocol 1: Seeding Plates with Mammalian Cells\nProtocol 2: DAPI Staining\nProtocol 3: Fix and DAPI Stain\nProtocol 4: Media Exchange\nProtocol 5: Primary Staining\n\nThe protocol begins with an empty reservoir for liquid waste, a 12-channel reservoir that contains what will be added to the plates, tips, eppendorf plate(s), and the P300-Multi attached to the left mount. Using up to 4 plates, the protocol will iterate through each plate, adding reagents to the plate and removing liquid.\n\nThe following steps are performed to each plate:\nRemove 120\u00b5L of media\nAdd 140\u00b5L of PBS\nRemove 140\u00b5L of PBS\nAdd 140\u00b5L of PBS\nRemove 140\u00b5L of PBS\nAdd 100\u00b5L of 2% PFA\nPause\nRemove 100\u00b5L of 2% PFA\nAdd 140\u00b5L of PBS+DAPI\nRemove 140\u00b5L of PBS+DAPI\nAdd 140\u00b5L of PBS\nRemove 140\u00b5L of PBS\nAdd 140\u00b5L of PBS\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons p300 Multi-Channel Pipette, GEN2\nOpentrons Tips\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL\nEppendorf Plate\nReagents\n\n\n\nSlot 1: Opentrons Tips, note: protocol saves tip state and will prompt user to replace tips when new tips are needed.\n\nSlot 2: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 1)\n\nSlot 3: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 2)\n\nSlot 5: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 3)\n\nSlot 6: Eppendorf Plate (Plate 4)\n\nSlot 7: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\n\nColumns 1-4: PBS\nColumns 5-8: PBS\nColumns 9-12: 2% PFA\n\nSlot 10: NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\n\nColumns 1-4: PBS+DAPI\nColumns 5-8: PBS\nColumns 9-12: PBS\n\nSlot 11: NEST 1-Well Reservoir, 195mL, for liquid waste\n\nNote: When filling the 12-well reservoirs with reagents, each column corresponds to a plate (there are 4 columns allocated per reagent).
