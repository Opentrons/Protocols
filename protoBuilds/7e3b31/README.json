    "description": "With this 3 part workflow, your OT-2 can use Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sampe Preparation Guide to convert 8-48 input total RNA samples into libraries having known strand origin to be used for cluster generation and DNA sequencing. This is Part 1 of 3: This OT-2 protocol uses the LT kit and follows the LS protocol found on pages 12-44 of the attached sample prep guide. Oligo-dT magnetic beads are used to isolate poly(A) RNA from input total RNA, followed by fragmentation, priming, and cDNA synthesis. The second-strand synthesis includes dUTP in order to quench the amplification of the second strand.",
