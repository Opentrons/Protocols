    "description": "This is a flexible protocol accommodating a wide range of commercial RNA extraction workflows for COVID-19 sample processing. The protocol is broken down into 5 main parts:\n binding buffer addition to samples\n bead wash 3x using magnetic module\n* final elution to chilled PCR plate\nLysed samples should be loaded on the magnetic module in a NEST 96-deepwell plate. For reagent layout in the 2 12-channel reservoirs used in this protocol, please see \"Setup\" below\nThis protocol allows your robot to create a master mix solution using any reagents stored in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube rack or a 2 mL screwcap tube rack. The master mix will be created in well A1 of the trough. The ingredient information will be provided as a CSV file. See Additional Notes for more details.\n\n \nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons magnetic module\nOpentrons temperature module\nNEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL\nNEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL\nNEST 96 Well Plate 100 \u00b5L PCR Full Skirt\nNEST 96 Deepwell Plate 2mL\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 \u00b5L\n\n\n\n\nReservoir 1: slot 5\nReservoir 2: slot 2\n\n",
