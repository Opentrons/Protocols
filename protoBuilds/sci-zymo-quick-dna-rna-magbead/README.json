The default output sample is DNA-free total RNA. A protocol parameter (below) can be used at the time of protocol download to skip the DNAseI step for an output sample containing combined DNA and total RNA. Additional protocol parameters can be used at the time of protocol download to skip or include any of these steps (for testing purposes, for a partially manual and partially automated process, for a custom sequence of steps etc.)",
