    "description": "This protocol automates the GenFind V3 protocol from Beckman Coulter for DNA isolation from whole blood or serum with magnetic particles. This protocol utilizes a P300-Multi channel pipette Gen2 (and optionally a p300-Single channel pipette Gen2) and gives the user the option to select a variable number of samples (Ideally a multiple of 8 for efficient use of reagents) and whether to dispense liquid waste in a 1-well reservoir in slot 6 or in the fixed trash container. The user can also choose whether they want to use Proteinase K and elution buffer from a tube-rack rather than the 12 well reservoir. \u00dfThis protocol is designed for holding the samples on the USA Scientific PlateOne\u00ae Deep 96-Well 2 mL Polypropylene Plate (P/N 1896-2800) on a 2nd generation Magnetic module. The purified samples are transferred to a Abgene\u2122 96 Well 0.8mL Polypropylene Deepwell Storage Plate (Thermo AB-0859) in the final step. The protocol uses the NEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL and the NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL as sources of reagents. All reagents except the two wash buffers (Wash WBB and Wash WBC are stored either in the twelve well reservoir or the tube rack)\nThe protocol is broken down into 5 main parts:\n Lysis buffer and proteinase K is added to the samples. The protocol is paused and the samples are incubated until the user is ready to continue. The pause allows the user to resuspend the magnetic particles in Bind BBB before adding the solution to the twelve well reservoir.\n Bind BBB is added and the samples are incubated in order to bind DNA in the lysed solution.\n The supernatant is discarded and the beads are washed two times with Wash WBB and two times with Wash WBC buffers.\n Elution buffer is added to the samples which are then incubated and mixed two times.\n* Finally the supernatants containing DNA are transferred to the target plate.\nExplanation of parameters below:\n Number of samples:  How many samples to run, it should ideally be a multiple of 8 for efficient use of resources.\n Blood cells or serum?: Choose what kind of samples to use for the protocol. This parameter will set the sample volume to 200 uL for blood cells, and 400 for serum samples. It will also set the elution volume to 200 uL for blood cell samples, and 40 uL for serum samples.\nThis setting will affect the volume requirements for all other reagents as well since they are all based on the starting volume.\n x offset for bead aspiration: How many millimeters away from the center of the sample wells to aspirate bead supernatant from in the x (left/right) direction, the default is 1 mm.\n Magnet extension (mm): How far from the base of the sample plate to extend the magnets of the magnet deck (default is 4.7 mm)\n Proteinase K location:  Choose whether the proteinase K is located in tube 1 of the tube rack, or well 1 of the 12 well reservoir\n Elution buffer location:  Choose whether the elution buffer is located in tube 2 to 8 of the tube rack, or well 6 and 7 of the 12 well reservoir\n* Liquid waste reservoir?: If set to yes the protocol will use a NEST 1 well 195 mL reservoir as a target of liquid waste, otherwise it will empty liquid waste into the regular trash bin.  \n",
