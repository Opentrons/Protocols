    "description": "This protocol automates the GenFind V3 protocol from Beckman Coulter for DNA isolation from whole blood or serum with magnetic particles. This protocol utilizes a P300-Multi Channel pipette and gives the user the option to select a variable number of samples (Should be a multiple of 8) and whether to dispense liquid waste in a reservoir in slot 6 or in the fixed trash container. This protocol is designed for holding the samples on the USA Scientific PlateOne\u00ae Deep 96-Well 2 mL Polypropylene Plate (P/N 1896-2800) on a 2nd generation magnetic module. The purified samples are transferred to a Abgene\u2122 96 Well 0.8mL Polypropylene Deepwell Storage Plate (Thermo AB-0859) in the final step. The protocol uses the NEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL and the NEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL as sources of reagents\nThe protocol is broken down into 5 main parts:\n Lysis buffer is added to the samples and proteinase K is added to the samples. The samples are incubated until the lysis reaction has completed\n Binding buffer containing paramagnetic particles are added and the samples are incubated in order to bind DNA\n The supernatant is discarded and the beads are washed two times with Wash WBB and two times with Wash WBC buffers.\n Elution buffer is added to the samples which are incubated.\n* Finally the eluted purified samples are transferred to the target plate\nExplanation of parameters below:\n Number of samples:  How many samples to run, it should ideally be a multiple of 8 for efficient use of resources.\n Blood cells or serum?: Choose what kind of samples to use for the protocol. This parameter will set the sample volume to 200 uL for blood cells, and 400 for serum samples. It will also set the elution volume to 200 uL for blood cell samples, and 40 uL for serum samples.\nThis setting will affect the volume requirements for all other reagents\n Liquid waste reservoir?: If set to yes the protocol will use a NEST 1 well 195 mL reservoir as a target of liquid waste, otherwise it will empty liquid waste into the regular trash bin.\n X offset for bead aspiration: How many millimeters away from the center of the sample wells to aspirate bead supernatant from, the default is 1 mm.\n",
