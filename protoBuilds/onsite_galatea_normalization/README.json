A csv is uploaded to the protocol in which the destination well in the final plate should be column 1 (source well and destination well are the same, so should be 1:1), the water transfer volume should be in column 5, and the dna transfer volume should be in column 4. Note: if \"top half of plate\" or \"bottom half of plate\" is selcted, then the multi-channel pipette will pick up four tips and will always aspirate from the top 4 rows of the final plate on slot 3 to dispense into the barcode plate, either in the top or bottom half (always from top half to either top or bottom half). The csv will run for as many rows as there are, and there should only be one row at the top for the header.\n\n\nFor water addition to the plate, if the tranfser volume is greater or equal to 5ul, it will transfer 5ul.\n\n\nFor DNA addition to plate, the pipette will transfer 6ul if the transfer volume is greater than 6ul. It will also transfer 1 if the transfer volume is less than 1ul.\n\n\nA slow aspiration rate and delay is employed for Buffer B, since it is a viscous liquid. \n\n",
