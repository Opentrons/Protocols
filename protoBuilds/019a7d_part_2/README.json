    "description": "This is part 2 of a 2 part protocol for prepping then loading nucleic acid onto agar plates. It requires both a multichannel and single channel 20ul pipette.\nPart one can be found here\nThe basic outline follows:\nThe assembly plate liquid is added to a Mix and Go plate. A heat shock can be performed, bringing the Mix and Go plate to 42 C for 40 seconds then back to the holding temperature of 4 C. After 30 minutes, agar plates are loaded with the resultant mixture as specified in the parameters. If desired, this Mix and Go plate's liquid can be added to a deep well plate and mixed with liquid culture.\nTips are reused for the same sample repeatedly, i.e. sample A1 on the Mix and Go will use A1 in the tip rack.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples: Number of samples in Mix and Go plate. Can be any number between 1 and 96\n 24 or 96 Distributions per Plate: Choose to use up to four agar plates with 24 samples each and/or one agar plate with up to 96 samples. Distribution of samples follows a common layout for either 24 well plates or 96 well plates on the agar\n Heat Shock: Choose yes or no to determine whether a heat shock will occur during the protocol. This heat shock takes place after adding to the Mix and Go plate. It raises the temperature to 42 C for 40 seconds before returning to 4 C\n Volume to Distribute on Agar: Choose a liquid volume to add to the agar plate(s). This can theoretically be many volumes above 1 ul but caution should be exercised so as not to co-mingle samples on the agar by overloading\n Add to Deep Well Plate: Choose yes or no to add to deep well plate. Yes results in a specified amount of liquid being added to the deep well plate 1 cm above the well bottom and mixed\n Volume to Add to Deep Well Plate: Specifies volume to add to the deep well plate if yes is chosen under \"Add to Deep Well Plate\"\n",
