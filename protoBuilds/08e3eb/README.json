During each run, all 9 plates will be filled with assay from the reservoir. At the conclusion of filling the 9 plates, the OT-2 will flash, pause, and prompt the user to replace the plates on the deck.\n\nThis protocol uses custom labware definitions for the 48-well reservoir (Agilent) and 96-well plate (MicroAmp Endura).
