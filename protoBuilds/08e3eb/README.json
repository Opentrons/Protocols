    "description": "This protocol automates the distribution of assays from a 48-well reservoir to 9, 96-well plates.\n\nUsing the customizable parameters below, you can specify which column to start picking up tips from and how many \"runs\" to perform. During each run, all 9 plates will be filled with assay from the reservoir. At the conclusion of filling the 9 plates, the OT-2 will flash, pause, and prompt the user to replace the plates on the deck.\n\nThis protocol uses custom labware definitions for the 48-well reservoir (Agilent) and 96-well plate (MicroAmp Endura).
