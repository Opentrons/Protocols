    "description": "\n\nThis protocol preps a 96 well plate with buffer, sample, and mastermix for PCR. See below for details on reagent setup, protocol steps, etc. Tube racks should be placed in order of the slot numbers on the deck, (1, 2, 3,...,7). The pipette will access each tube rack in this order beginning from tube rack 1 on slot 1. The pipettes will access each tuberack by column (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2...), meaning a 94 sample run would have all tube racks in slots 1-6 filled, with 4 tubes in A1, B1, C1, A2 of slot 7.\n\n\nIf running a full plate (94 samples), the protocol will use the multi-channel pipette to dispense mastermix to all 96 wells. For SBM, it will use the multi-channel to dispense into the first 11 columns, and then the single-channel to dispense into the first 6 wells of the 12th column. If running less than 94 samples, say 12 for example, the protocol will use the multi-channel to dispense mastermix and SBM into the first column, then the single channel to dispense to the first four wells of column 2, then finally mastermix and SBM into G12, H12. Note, that extra SBM and mastermix should be placed in wells 1-7 depending on the number of samples.\n\n\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples (1-94): Specify the number of samples for this run (1-94).\n Reaction plate: Specify whether using the non-skirted or half-skirted reaction plate on slot 9. Slot 8 should always use a non-skirted plate.\n* P20 Single/Multi Pipette Mounts: Specify which mount (left or right) to host each pipette.\n",
