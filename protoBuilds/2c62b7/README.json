    "description": "This protocol automates the Soil Protocol from the Mag-Bind\u00ae Environmental DNA 96 Kit from Omega Bio-tek.\nThe protocol on the OT-2 begins at Step 14 with the addition of the XP1 Buffer and Mag-Bind\u00ae Particles RQ. These two reagents should be prepared as a master mix (referred to as Master Mix 2) in the OT-2 protocol. The first 13 steps of the protocol should be prepared and performed manually. Please refer to the protocol steps section below for corresponding OT-2 steps.\n\n\n\nTemperature Module (GEN2)\nMagnetic Module (GEN2)\nNEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate\nNEST 96 Well Plate 100 \u00b5L PCR Full Skirt\nOpentrons 96-well Aluminum Block\nNEST 12-Well Reservoirs, 15 mL\nOpentrons 300uL Tips\nOpentrons 200uL Filter Tips\nP300 8-Channel Electronic Pipette (GEN2)\nMag-Bind\u00ae Environmental DNA 96 Kit\n\nFor more detailed information on compatible labware, please visit our Labware Library.\n\n\nDeck Setup\n\nNote: The Tip Isolator is simply an empty Opentrons tip rack that is filled with water.

It is then mixed again to prevent the beads from settling in the reservoir (repeats every 3 columns of samples)\n\n\nIncubate at Room Temp for 10 minutes while mixing (increase yields). Each column is mixed 2 times via tip mixing. Park tips in the Tip Isolator.\n\n\nEngage Magnetic Module and Delay for 5 minutes (settling time parameter) to allow mag beads to settle on the walls. \n\n\nAspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads.
