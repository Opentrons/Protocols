The protocol starts on the OT-2 from step 14 and has modified steps that are written below.\n\n14. Add 1 volume XP1 Buffer and 20 \u00b5L Mag-Bind\u00ae Particles RQ (Prepared as Master Mix 2). Mixing is performed 10 times thoroughly, referred to as `tip mixing` (start mixing from the middle, then the bottom, then back to the top)\n\n**Note**: The master mix is thoroughly mixed and then transferred to 3 columns at a time. It is then mixed again to prevent the beads from settling in the reservoir (repeats every 3 columns of samples)\n\n15. Incubate at Room Temp for 10 minutes while mixing (increase yields). Each column is mixed 2 times via tip mixing. Park tips in the Tip Isolator.\n\n16. Engage Magnetic Module and Delay for 5 minutes (settling time parameter) to allow mag beads to settle on the walls. \n\n17. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads. Reuse tips from step 15 and discard tips.\n\n18. Disengage Magnetic Module\n\n19. Add max volume (300uL on P300 Pipette) of VHB Buffer to NEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom (Dispensed at a fast rate to agitate the beads).\n\n20. Tip Mixing is performed and tips are conserved in the tip isolator. (Vortexing steps are substituted with Tip Mixing)\n\n21. Engage Magnetic Module and Delay for 5 minutes.\n\n22. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads.\n\n23. Disengage Magnetic Module\n\n24. Add 500 uL of 70% Ethanol to NEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom\n\n25. Tip Mixing is performed (reuse tips from step 20).\n\n26. Engage Magnetic Module and Delay for 5 minutes.\n\n27. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads. \n\n28. Repeat 23-27 for a second ethanol wash\n\n29. While the plate is on top of the Magnetic Module and is engaged, delay 1 minute and then remove any liquid.\n\n30. While Magnetic Module is engaged, delay for 10 minutes to allow mag beads to dry.\n\n31. Heat elution buffer to 70C on the Temperature Module, then transfer 100 uL of elution buffer.\n\n32. Tip Mixing is performed (Tips are discarded).\n\n33. Engage Magnetic Module and Delay for 2 minutes to allow mag beads to settle on the walls.\n\n34.
