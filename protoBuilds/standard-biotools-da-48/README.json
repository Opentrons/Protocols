Prepare the Samples, the Assays, and the IFC Referring as described in one of the following workflows from the Standard Biotools X9 User Guide:\n- Gene Expression Using the 48.48 IFC-X with TaqMan Assays\n2. Prepare a Sample Plate by transferring 6 \u00b5L of sample to 48 wells of a 96-well plate\n3. Prepare an Assay Plate by transferring 6 \u00b5L of assay to 48 wells of a 96-well plate\n4. NOTE: All wells (indicated below in blue) must have liquid\n5. Centrifuge the Sample and Assay plates to ensure liquids are at the bottom of the wells\n6. Prepare the 48.48 IFC:\n- Add control line fluid to the accumulators according to the workflow selected in step 1 (Indicated above by red arrows)\n- Remove the protective film from the bottom of the IFC",
