    "description": "Links:\n* Part 1\n* Part 2\n* Part 3\n* Part 4\n* Part 5\nThis custom Library Purification protocol is part 3/5 of the Verogen ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep kit. The protocol is broken down into 4 main parts:\n* binding buffer addition to samples\n* bead wash 2x using magnetic module\n* final elution to chilled PCR plate\nSamples should be loaded on the magnetic module in an Abgene Midi plate. For reagent layout in the 2 12-channel reservoirs used in this protocol, please see \"Setup\" below.\nFor sample traceability and consistency, samples are mapped directly from the magnetic extraction plate (magnetic module, slot 11) to the elution PCR plate (temperature module, slot 3). Magnetic extraction plate well A1 is transferred to elution PCR plate A1, extraction plate well B1 to elution plate B1, ..., D2 to D2, etc.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n* park tips: If set to yes (recommended), the protocol will conserve tips between reagent addition and removal. Tips will be stored in the wells of an empty rack corresponding to the well of the sample that they access (tip parked in A1 of the empty rack will only be used for sample A1, tip parked in B1 only used for sample B1, etc.). If set to no, tips will always be used only once, and the user will be prompted to manually refill tipracks mid-protocol for high throughput runs.\n* track tips across protocol runs: If set to yes, tip racks will be assumed to be in the same state that they were in the previous run. For example, if one completed protocol run accessed tips through column 5 of the 3rd tiprack, the next run will access tips starting at column 6 of the 3rd tiprack. If set to no, tips will be picked up from column 1 of the 1st tiprack.\n",
