Agar plates should be prepared by filling Nunc Omnitrays with 30 mL of melted agar. These should be dried on as flat a surface as possible to ensure consistent heights across the plate.\nCalibration on the agar plate should be performed so that the tips are just barely touching the agar as the \"top of the well\".
