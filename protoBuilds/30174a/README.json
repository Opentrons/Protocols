The protocol does this using an input .csv file with 3 columns: plate1 (for the well location to transfer), DNA (for volume of DNA to transfer), and TE Buffer (for volume of TE to transfer). TE is loaded from a trough initially into Plate 2, and then the DNA is loaded into Plate 2 from Plate 1.\nThe protocol can transfer at 1-20ul of DNA and 20-200ul of TE into Plate 2. \n\n\n\nOpentrons P300-single channel electronic pipettes (GEN2)\nOpentrons P20-single channel electronic pipettes (GEN2)\nOpentrons 200ul Filter Tips\nOpentrons 20ul Filter Tips\nNEST 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL\nNEST 0.1 mL 96-Well PCR Plate, Full Skirt\n",
