Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.\n5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.\n6.

The P20 will mix the Mastermix two times, aspirate 20\u00b5L, then dispense 2.5\u00b5L in each well, repeating this process until complete. When done, the pipette will return any extra Mastermix to the tube, then drop the tip.\n3. For each location in **SourcePos** and **PreampPos**, the P20 will pick up a tip, go to the SourcePos and mix three times, transfer 2.5\u00b5L to the PreampPos, mix three times, then drop the tip.\n4. Once all transfers are completed for the above step, the user will be prompted to remove the plate for amplification. When ready to begin part two, the user will be prompted to load the Preamp Plate and Loading Plate (if not already loaded) and make sure that enough OpenArray Mastermix is in the tube in D6 of the Tube Rack.\n5. The P20 will pick up a tip, then distribute 3.75\u00b5L of OpenArray Mastermix to all wells listed in the **LoadPos1** and **LoadPos2** columns of the Transfer CSV.
