    "description": "This protocol uses single-channel P300 and P1000 pipettes to perform plate filling steps with 1-5 input samples for each of up to 4 test plates to be filled using the deck layout and source and destination locations displayed in the attached .json file deck map and source and destination wells (note: the attached json file is for visualization of the deck layout and location of source and destination wells using Opentrons Protocol Designer, it is not a fully-developed .json protocol to be run on the OT-2, the pipetting technique and transfer order have been modified for run time reasons). All transfers required for set up of the first test plate are completed prior to the start of the next test plate to minimize the per-plate run time. The user can pause the robot in order to remove completed plates during the run. Multi pre-air gaps with multiple aspirations are performed to enable repeat dispenses at the top of the well without need for blowout, tip touch or tip drops. User-determined parameters are available to specify the number of samples in each row of the tube rack.\n",
