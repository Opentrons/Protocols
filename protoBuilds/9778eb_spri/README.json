    "description": "This protocol purifies samples using SPRI beads with an option to perform a size selection with two separate bead ratios. Size selection requires two magnetic modules.\nBeads are added at a specified ratio to the samples, mixed, and left to incubate. If size selection is to be performed, the supernatant is then removed to the second magnetic module for a second bead purification where the resulting supernatant is removed to the liquid waste.\nAfter bead purification(s), two 200uL ethanol washes are performed. The beads are left to air dry for a set amount of time before a set volume of elution liquid is added, mixed with the beads, left to incubate for a set time, and separated from the beads. This supernatant is removed to an awaiting plate in slot 3.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of Samples: How many samples are in the starting 96 well plate, 1-96 allowed. Multiples of 8 for full columns will have the most efficient reagent use\n Initial Sample Volume: Volume in uL for starting samples. This is used to help calculate bead volume addition\n Bead Ratio 1: Bead to sample ratio used to calculate bead volume addition. First addition for size selection and only addition for non-size selection\n Bead Ratio 2: Bead to sample ratio used to calculate bead volume addition for second bead addition during size selection. This is not used during non-size selection protocols with a single bead addition\n Transfer Volume: During size selection, how much volume to transfer from first magnetic module plate to second. This is needed to properly calculate second bead addition volume for proper size selection\n Bead Air Dry Time: How many minutes beads will be left to air dry after ethanol wash steps. Default is 10 minutes\n Bead Incubation Time: How many minutes beads will be left to incubate with samples during first and second addition. Default is 5 minutes\n Bead Separation Time: How many minutes beads will be left to separate on the magnetic module. Default is 5 minutes\n Elution Solution Volume: How much liquid will be added to washed and dried beads for elution. Default volume is 50 uL\n Elution Time: How many minutes the elution solution will incubate with the beads. Default is 10 minutes\n Final Plate Volume: How much liquid will be transferred from the beads mixed with elution liquid to final elution plate in slot 3. Default is 50 uL\n Flash Robot on Pause: Set whether the OT-2 will flash when trash is full, tips need refilling, or general user intervention is needed. Default is flashing.\n P300 Multi Channel Pipette Mount: Select which mount side the p300 multichannel pipette is connected to. Default is left. The p20 multichannel will be set to the opposite side.\n Size Selection or Single Purification: Select whether the OT-2 will perform a single bead purification with one magnetic module or a dual bead ratio-based size selection with two magnetic modules. Default is size selection.\n",
