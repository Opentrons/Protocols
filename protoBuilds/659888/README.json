The tips are to not touch the agar medium but instead dispense right above it, saving up to 5 times the number of tips per run. Column 1 of the source plate is dispensed into into column 1 of all agar plates in a multi-dispense fashion to additionally save time.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Number of plates: Specify the number of agar plates (1-5) to fill for this run.\n Number of columns in each plate: Specify the number of columns (1-12) in each agar plate to fill.\n Number of rows in each plate: Specify the number of rows (1-8) in each agar plate to fill.\n P20 Multi-Channel Pipette Mount: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 multi-channel pipette.\n",
