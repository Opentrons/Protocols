Samples are loaded in 15ml tubes and transferred to a 96-wellplate for lysis and temperature incubations on an Opentrons temperature module. The samples are then transferred to a deepwell plate mounted on an Opentrons magnetic module for a 1-wash magnetic bead-based RNA extraction.\nExplanation of protocol parameters below:\n* track tips across protocol runs: If set to yes, tip racks will be assumed to be in the same state that they were in the previous run. For example, if one completed protocol run accessed tips through column 5 of the 3rd tiprack, the next run will access tips starting at column 6 of the 3rd tiprack. If set to no, tips will be picked up from column 1 of the 1st tiprack.\n\n \nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons magnetic module GEN2\nOpentrons temperature module GEN2\nNEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL\nUSA Scientific PlateOne 96 Deepwell Plate 2mL\nBio-Rad 96 Well Plate 350 \u00b5L PCR\nOpentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 and 1000 \u00b5L\nOpentrons P300-Multi GEN2 and P1000-Single GEN2 electronic pipettes\n\n\n \n \nReservoir (slot 2):\n channel 2: magnetic beads\n channel 4: wash buffer\n channel 5: master mix\n channel 12: liquid waste (loaded empty)",
