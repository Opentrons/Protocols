    "description": "\nThis protocol is a custom modification to the Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit Protocol: Fully Automated already found in the Opentrons Protocol Library. This version of the protocol features lowers aspiration flow rates to avoid bead pick-up, longer incubation times, and less volume of supernatant removed. This version also features both generations of the magnetic module. If running 24 samples with this protocol, the protocol will stop when it runs out of tips, prompting the user to replace tip racks.\nWith this protocol, your OT-2 can fully automate the entire Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit. Simply press start and your OT-2 can automate this entire workflow without any hands-on requirement - from enzymatic prep to sequence ready libraries! Up to 16 libraries can be prepared in under 3 hours.\nFor more information about the Swift 2S Turbo Kit and the Swift 2S Turbo Unique Dual Indexing Primer Kit on the OT-2, please see our Application Note here: Rapid high quality next generation sequencing library preparation with Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kits on the Opentrons OT-2\n\n\n\nTo purchase consumables, labware, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\nAttention: You can now purchase all of the consumables needed to run this protocol by clicking here.\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.15.0 or later)\nSwift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit\nSwift 2S Turbo Unique Dual Indexing Primer Kit\nOmega Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS Kit\nOpentrons Thermocycler Module\nOpentrons Temperature Module with Aluminum Block Set\nOpentrons Magnetic Module\nOpentrons P20 Single-Channel Pipette or Opentrons P50 Single-Channel Pipette*\nOpentrons P300 Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons Tips\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nNEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL\nNEST 2mL Tubes\nSamples, resuspended in Low EDTA TE, bringing the total volume to 19.5\u00b5L\n\n*Opentrons now sells the P20 Single-Channel Pipette in place of the P50 Single-Channel Pipette.
