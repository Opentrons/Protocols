    "description": "This protocol is based on the ML_normalization protocol and it performs a custom sample normalization from a source PCR plate to a second PCR plate, diluting with diluent (e.g. buffer or water) from a reservoir. Sample and diluent volumes are specified via .csv file in the following format, including the header line (empty lines ignored):\nsource plate well,destination plate well,volume sample (\u00b5l),volume diluent (\u00b5l)\nA1, A1, 2, 28\nDiluent is transferred first from the 12 well reservoir to the target plate wells as specified in the csv using the same pipette tip. After finishing, the pipette(s) drop their/its tip(s) and transfer samples to the target wells.\nThis protocol loads the sample and destination plate on 2nd generation temperature modules\nExplanation of parameters below:\n* input .csv file: Here, you should upload a .csv file formatted as described above.\n* P20 GEN2 mount: Choose whether to load the p20 in the right or left mount\n* P300 GEN2 mount: Choose whether to load the p300 in the right or left mount\n* Aspiration height from bottom of the plate wells [mm]: Offset to aspirate from the bottom of the source plate wells (in units of mm)\n* Dispensing height from bottom of the plate wells [mm]: Offset for dispenses from the bottom of the destination plate wells (in units of mm)\n* Aspiration height from bottom of the reservoir wells [mm]: Offset to aspirate from the bottom of the reservoir wells (in units of mm)\n* Flow rate multiplier: By setting this multiplier to a value 0 < x < 1 the rate of sample aspiration and dispensing will be slowed down. The default value is 0.5 resulting in aspiration at half of the regular speed.\n",
