    "description": "This protocol is part one of a three-part series to automate the Twist Library Prep protocol. See below for all three parts:\n\nPart 1: Fragmentation & Repair\nPart 2: Ligate Adapters\nPart 3: PCR Amplification\n\nThis protocol begins with samples diluted to 5ng/\u00b5L (if you still need to normalize your sample concentration, try our Normalization protocol) in either PCR tubes or a 96-well plate. Enzymatic Fragmentation Mastermix (40\u00b5L) is added to empty PCR tubes/96-well plate first, before 10\u00b5L of normalized sample is added. The PCR tubes/96-well plate containing sample and mastermix should then be moved off deck to thermocycler and run on the program listed in the Twist Library Prep protocol. After the thermocycler, the samples can be returned to the OT-2 for part two of this protocol.\n\nIf you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at protocols@opentrons.com.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.19.0 or later)\nOpentrons p20 (Single- or Multi-Channel) Pipette\nOpentrons p300 (Single- or Multi-Channel) Pipette\nOpentrons Tips\noptional: Opentrons Thermocycler or Opentrons Temperature Module, for active cooling during protocol\nNEST 96-Well PCR Plate\nOpentrons Tube Rack or Aluminum Block Set\nMicrocentrifuge Tube, 1.5mL or PCR strips\nSamples\nTwist Enzymatic Fragmentation and Twist Universal Adapter System\n\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 1: Normalized samples in NEST 96-Well PCR Plate or PCR tubes on 96-Well Aluminum Block\n\nSlot 2 (if using P300 Single-Channel): Enyzmatic Fragmentation Master Mix in Microcentrifuge Tube, 1.5mL in Opentrons Tube Rack or 24-Well Aluminum Block\nTubes should be loaded in A1, A2, and A3; each tube can accommodate up to 32 samples and will be used sequentially\nSlot 2 (if using P300 Multi-Channel): Enyzmatic Fragmentation Master Mix in NEST 96-Well PCR Plate or PCR tubes on 96-Well Aluminum Block\nColumns 1, 2, and 3 should be loaded; each column can accommodate up to 32 samples and will be used sequentially\n\nSlot 3: Opentrons Tips for P300\n\nSlot 6: Opentrons Tips for P20\n\nSlot 7: NEST 96-Well PCR Plate or PCR tubes on 96-Well Aluminum Block with optional Opentrons Thermocycler or Opentrons Temperature Module, for active cooling during protocol\n\nUsing the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.\n* P20 Type: Select the type (Single- or Multi-Channel) to use; P20 should should be mounted on the left mount\n* P300 Type: Select the type (Single- or Multi-Channel) to use; P300 should should be mounted on the right mount\n* Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples to run (1-96).\n* Module (for cooling): Select whether or not an Opentrons module will be used for active cooling during protocol\n* Destination Plate: Select the labware that will be used to combine the samples and the master mix\n* Sample Plate: Select the labware that will contain the gDNA samples\n* Master Mix Labware: Select the labware that will contain the enzymatic fragmentation master mix\n\n",
