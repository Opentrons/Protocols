    "description": "The distribute function in our Python API allows volumes from the same source well to be combined within the same tip and allow for multiple dispenses to multiple locations. However, sometimes additional parameters may be necessary such as overage volume, custom blowout locations, and air gaps. This protocol provides a custom distribute function that can be used to implement additional parameters and custom functionalities that fall outside of the default Python API distribute function.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nOpentrons OT-2\nOpentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.15.0 or later)\nOpentrons Single-Channel Pipette and corresponding Tips\nCorning 24 Well Plate 3.4 mL Flat\nCorning 6 Well Plate 16.8 mL Flat\n\nFor more detailed information on compatible labware, please visit our Labware Library.\n\n\nUsage: distribute_custom(pipette, vol, source, dest, overage, blowout, air_gap)\nInput:\ndistribute_custom(p300, 50, plate1['A1'], plate2.rows_by_name()['A'], 30, trash_plate['A1'], 10)\nOutput:\nPicking up tip from A1 of Opentrons 96 Tip Rack 300 \u00b5L on 4\nAspirating 230.0 uL from A1 of Plate 1 on 1 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A1 of Plate 1 on 1 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A1 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A1 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A2 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A2 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A3 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A3 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A4 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A4 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nBlowout at A1 of Trash Plate on 3\nDispensing 300.0 uL into A1 of Trash Plate on 3 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAspirating 130.0 uL from A1 of Plate 1 on 1 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A1 of Plate 1 on 1 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A5 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A5 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDispensing 60.0 uL into A6 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nAir Gap\nAspirating 10.0 uL from A6 of Plate 2 on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec\nBlowout at A1 of Trash Plate on 3\nDispensing 300.0 uL into A1 of Trash Plate on 3 at 92.86 uL/sec\nDropping tip into A1 of Opentrons Fixed Trash on 12\nIn this example 50 uL are distributed to wells across row A on plate2 from well A1 in plate1.
