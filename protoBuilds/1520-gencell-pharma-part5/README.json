The protocol allows for 4, 8, 12, or 16 samples in pools of 4 each, and completes the fifth of 8 parts for the total process. For proper reagent setup, please see 'Additional Info' below.\nNote that this protocol is written specifically for multi-channel pipettes--tips are iterated through from the bottom left (well H1) of the rack to ensure that the pipette only picks up one tip. In addition, the decks slot below the tip racks are intentionally left open so that the multi-channel pipette does not crash.\n\nYou will need:\n P10 8-Channel Electronic Pipette\n P50 8-Channel Electronic Pipette\n P100 8-Channel Electronic Pipette\n Opentrons 10\u00b5l Tips\n Opentrons 300\u00b5l Tips\n 4x6 2ml Tube Rack\n Non-Skirted PCR Plates\n PCR Strips\n Deepwell Storage Plate\n Magnetic Stand", "robot": ["OT-2"], "modules": ["Temperature Module with Aluminum Block Set", "Magnetic Module"], "reagents": ["Refer to TruSight Rapid Capture Reference Guide"], "process": "\nSet the number of pools you will be processing.\nDownload your protocol.\nUpload your protocol into the OT App.\nSet up your deck according to the deck map.\nCalibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support article.\nHit \"Run\".\nThe temperature module will heat to 42\u02daC for precise sample incubation later in the protocol.\nStreptavidin beads are mixed and transferred to each pool in the deepwell plate, which is mixed after the transfer.
