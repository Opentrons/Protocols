    "description": "This protocol automates the MGI Easy Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit and offers the user the ability to modify parameters such as the number of samples and the types of labware used.\n\nThis protocol has been optimized for use on the OT-2 and begins with an empty deepwell plate on the Magnetic Module. Lysis mix is first added to the plate, then samples are transferred to the lysis mix and mixed.
