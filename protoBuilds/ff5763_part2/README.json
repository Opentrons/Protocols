The multi-channel 300ul pipette is then used to mix the samples before the plate is tranferred to an off-deck thermocycler. Once the post-tagmentation thermocycler program has completed, the plate is returned to slot 2 and 'Resume' is clicked on the OT-2 application\nSamples are subsequently moved to a deep well plate locked onto the magnetic module in slot 4. The magnetic module is engaged and left for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes the supernatant is discarded into the liquid trash in slot 6.\nTagmentation Wash Buffer (TWB) is utilized to wash the samples in the magnetic module twice as follows:\n100ul TWB is added to the samples, the magnetic module is engaged for 3 minutes, then supernatant is removed to liquid trash in slot 6.\nAfter the two TWB washes a third TWB wash is partially done. 100ul TWB is added to the samples and the magnetic module is engaged.
