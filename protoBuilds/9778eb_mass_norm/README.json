    "description": "This protocol uses values in a CSV to normalize samples in a 96 well plate. The CSV requires starting and finishing concentrations broken up into mass/moles and volumes. This allows for minimal user calculations before loading samples. Additionally, units can be different from run to run and even sample to sample provided the starting and finishing units are the same. E.g. sample A1 is nanograms/uL and will be diluted to a set concentration in well A1 in the normalized plate while sample B1 is moles/uL and will be diluted to a set molarity in well B1.\nThis protocol also checks if normalization is possible with the given concentrations and will list the failed wells at the end of the protocol run. E.g. C1 starting concentration is 15 ng/uL and the stated final concentration target is 20 ng/uL so C1 will be added to the 'failed well' list at the protocol end.\nExplanation of complex parameters below:\n Volume of Water in Falcon Tube: Starting volume of nuclease free water in the on-deck tube rack. This is in mL and will be used to track liquid height\n Source Plate Type: 96 well plate samples will start the protocol in\n Destination Plate Type: 96 well plate samples will end the protocol in\n P20 Single GEN2 Mount: Defines which side the P20 single pipette will be mounted on. The P300 single pipette will be mounted on the opposite side\n* Transfer .csv File: Here, you should upload a .csv file formatted like the example CSV located here\n",
