Note, samples should be put in tube racks by column starting from the tube rack in Slot 1. The tube rack in Slot 1 will be transferred down by column before the tube rack in Slot 4 is transferred, and so on.\n* Volume Dispensed: Specify the volume (in microliters) to transfer from the tube rack to the plate. A value greater than 100 will use the P1000 pipette. A value less than 100 will use the P300 pipette. \n* Delay Time after Aspirating (in seconds): Since saliva is being transferred, often times a delay after aspiration allows the pipette to achieve the full volume. Specify the amount of time in seconds after each aspiration (a value of 0 can be inputted).\n* Aspiration Height: Specify the height (in mm) from the bottom of the tubes the pipette will aspirate from.\n P1000 Single GEN2 Mount*: Specify the mount side for the P300 Single GEN2 pipette",
