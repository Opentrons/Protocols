The first part of the protocol completes at this point allowing the user to move the working plate to an agitation device, an antibody/target protein incubation period determined by the user. After incubation, the process proceeds with the second part of the protocol on the OT2. Dynabeads/antibody/target protein complex will be washed, eluted and heated to denature. The final product is ready for SDS-PAGE.  \n",
