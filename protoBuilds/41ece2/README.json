    "description": "Note: This protocol is a modified version of this drug dilution protocol. For a note on the differences, please see the note on modifications.\n\nThis protocol is an updated version of a drug dilution protocol designed with Protocol Designer.\n\nIn this protocol, the p300-multi channel pipette (GEN1) is used to transfer 100\u00b5L media to all of the columns of the three dilution plates (10uM, 1uM, and 0.1uM). When transferring the media, the same tips (column 1) will be used for all transfers, but after every four transfers, the pipette will return the tips to the tiprack and pick up them up again to ensure a good seal with the tips.\nAfter the media is added, the p10-multi channel pipette is used for the dilutions, transferring 10\u00b5L from a stock plate in slot 10, to the first dilution plate and so on... (using the same set of tip for each column of dilutions).\nFinally, the p300-multi will be used again, this time transferring 100\u00b5L from the reservoir in slot 11 to the three dilution plates. These transfers will follow the same pattern for tip usage as the earlier transfer with the p300-multi, but instead use the tips from column 2.\n\nModifications: In this modified version of the protocol, 100\u00b5L of media is added to columns 2-12 of the first two plates and 90\u00b5L of media is added to columns 2-12 of the last plate. When performing the dilution, only columns 2-11 are accessed, leaving column 1 completely empty and column 12 without drug. Finally, there is an optional parameter, Add Cells + Media?, that if selected, will add 100\u00b5L from the reservoir to columns 2-12 of the three dilution plates, 2mm above the dispense height of the original protocol, otherwise, the protocol will end after the dilution.\n\n\nTo purchase tips, reagents, or pipettes, please visit our online store or contact our sales team at info@opentrons.com\n\nP300 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN1)\nP10 Multi-Channel Pipette\nOpentrons 300\u00b5l Pipette Tips\nOpentrons 10\u00b5L Pipette Tips\nAxygen 1-Well Reservoir, 90mL\nCorning 96-Well Plate, 360\u00b5L Flat\n\n\n\nDeck Layout\n\nSlot 1: Corning 96-Well Plate (Drug Dilution 0.1\u00b5M)\n\nSlot 2: Opentrons 300\u00b5l Pipette tips\n\nSlot 4: Corning 96-Well Plate (Drug Dilution 1\u00b5M)\n\nSlot 5: Opentrons 10\u00b5L Pipette Tips\n\nSlot 7: Corning 96-Well Plate (Drug Dilution 10\u00b5M)\n\nSlot 10: Corning 96-Well Plate (Drug Stock)\n",
