# `Protocols` Repo Data Analytics and Visualization

This is a location for data analytics scripts, raw `.csv` files, and visualization code for data analysis and visualization for the `Protocols` repository.

## Launching the Tool

First you should make sure that you run `make setup-data` within the `protocols` top level folder.
If you are up-to-date on all other directories you can simply run `make ` instead.
Next you have two options:

1. From the top level folder type: `make vis`
2. Open your browser and type in: `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`
