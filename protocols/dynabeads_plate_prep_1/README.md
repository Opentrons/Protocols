# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Protein Purification
	* Thermo Fisher Dynabeads™ Protein A

## Description
This protocol (Plate Prep 1) performs pipetting to transfer reagents (Dynabeads and antibody dilution) from 15 mL conical tubes to a 96 well deepwell plate (the reagent plate) on the OT2. This reagent plate is used for Dynabeads for IP Reagent-In-Plate protocol Part 1. The user can determine the number of samples to be processed.

### Protocol Steps
1. Bead slurry (reagent stock in 15 mL tubes, slot 5) is transferred to
the reagent plate (96 well deepwell plate A1-H1, slot 4) by the single
channel pipette.
2. Antibody solutions (reagent stock in 15 mL tubes, slot 5) is
transferred to the reagent plate (96 well deepwell plate A2-H2, slot 4)
by the single channel pipette.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters (the number of samples to be processed).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the OT App.
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tipracks, and pipette using the OT App. For
calibration tips, check out our support articles.
6. Hit "Run".
