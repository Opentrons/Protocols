# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Cell-Free Gene Expression


## Description
This protocol automates the cell-free gene expression test as outlined by users at TU Munich. See below:</br>
</br>
*This protocol sets up a cell-free gene expression experiment (TXTL test) in a 384-well plate. A TXTL sample is composed of cell extract (E), buffer (B), and a plasmid coding for the desired genes. The cell extract and buffer volume in each sample is fixed, the volume of plasmid in each sample depends on the plasmid stock concentration and the desired sample concentration of the plasmid. The final volume of 15µl is reached by adding nuclease-free water to the sample.*</br>
</br>
With the parameters, the user is able to test separate samples for different plasmids coding for the fluorescent proteins (ex. RFP, YFP, GFP and CFP) and measure up to 3 replicates for each of them. In addition, up to two blank samples containing E+B and water are made. First, mastermixes of plasmid and water are made, then distributed to the corresponding wells in the 384-well plate. Then E+B mixes are prepared and also distributed to the corresponding wells.</br>
</br>
This protocol uses a custom labware definition for the Brand 384-well plate. When downloading the protocol, the labware definition (a JSON file) will be included for use with this protocol. For more information on using custom labware on the OT-2, please see this article: [Using labware in your protocols](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols)</br>
</br>
In the case that the protocol needs more tips than can be accommodated, the robot will pause, flash the rail lights, and ask the user to replace the tiprack.
