# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
     * Plate Filling

## Description

This protocol uses a p300 multi-channel pipette to run a separate, preparative process to put 300 ul tips into a custom arrangement required for use of a multi-channel pipette with only four tips attached on alternating nozzles for use with a custom labware rack which contains 6 columns of 4 tubes. The starting deck arrangement requires either 2, 4 or 6 tip boxes. Half of those tip boxes must be completely full while the other half must be completely empty.

This protocol was developed as a separate preparative process to set up a custom arrangement of 300 ul tips needed to use a custom rack (with 6 columns of 4 wells each) in the attached Custom Cap Filling protocol.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: Place completely full tipracks opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul in deck slots 7, 8 and 9. Place completely empty tipracks opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul in deck slots 4, 5 and 6.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Move 4 tips from each column of the full boxes to the corresponding column of the empty boxes.
2. Pick up and drop 3 tips, then 2 tips, then 1 tip for each column to put tips in alternating rows A, C, E, and G.
3. Note - this same process can be performed with conventional pipette movements and fewer steps (faster runtime) if a p300 single-channel pipette is available.

### Deck Setup
![deck layout](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/063611-part-2/tiprack_reformatting_layout.png)

* Opentrons p300 tips opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul (these boxes should be full) (Deck Slots 7, 8, 9)
* Opentrons p300 tips opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul (these boxes are initially empty) (Deck Slots 4, 5, 6)

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Indicate the box count as 2 (one full, one empty), 4 (two full, two empty), or 6 (three full, three empty) using the parameters available on this page.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
