## Description
This protocol transfers a specified volume of developer solution into reservoir cartridges within a custom 216-well plate. The developer solution is aspirated from a Nest 195mL reservoir, then distributed to the 216-well plate down by column. Transfers are distributed in chunks of 3 between the reservoir and plate, with a delay and blow out step for viscous liquid considerations. Extra developer solution is aspirated to ensure that each cartridge receives adequate distribution.
