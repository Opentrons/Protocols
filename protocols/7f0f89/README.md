# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling


## Description
This protocol transfers a specified volume of developer solution into reservoir cartridges within a custom 216-well plate. The developer solution is aspirated from a Nest 195mL reservoir, then distributed to the 216-well plate down by column. Transfers are distributed in chunks of 3 between the reservoir and plate, with a delay and blow out step for viscous liquid considerations. Extra developer solution is aspirated to ensure that each cartridge receives adequate distribution.

## Process

1. Download your protocol package containing the custom labware definitions for the reservoir and plate.
2. Upload the labware definition in the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app). For help, please see [this article](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols).
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
