## Description
With this protocol, your robot can perform sterile cell culture workflows. First, the robot will transfer media and cells from two separate reservoirs into a single well plate with a multi-channel pipette in reverse pipetting mode. It will pause for 2 minutes so that user will have time to move the target plate from the deck into an incubator. The robot will then transfer the solvent and drug into separate falcon tubes to prepare for the serial dilution on a 96 well source plate. After the dilution series has been performed, the robot will wait for 2 minutes while user move the target plate back onto the deck. All the media will be aspirated from all wells on the target plate. The source plate will then copy the source plate to the target plate. After pausing the robot for 24.5 hours, the robot will at last transfer solution from a third reservoir into each well of the target plate using reverse pipetting method.

### Modules

### Reagents

## Process
1. Input your desired drug volume to be transferred into the falcon tube.
2. Input your desired final volume of the solution in each source well plate. 
3. Input your desired media and DMSO volume to be transferred to each well of the source plate.
4. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](http://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map image in the app.
5. Calibrate your tiprack, pipette, and labware using the OT app. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/getting-started/software-setup/calibrating-the-pipet).
