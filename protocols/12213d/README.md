## Description
This protocol removes ethanol from a plate on the MagDeck and requires manual intervention by the user.</br>
</br>
After incubating on the MagDeck for 5 minutes, 150µL will be removed from each well. The user will then be prompted to remove the plate and centrifuge. After centrifuging, the user will replace the plate and a second incubation and liquid transfer will occur.
