# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Aliquoting

## Description
This flexible protocol automates the transferring of samples in 12mL tubes to dilution buffer, then to Visby device for rapid Covid testing.</br>
</br>

---
</br>
**Protocol Steps**</br>
1. The protocol begins by transferring (up to 5) samples from row A in slot 2 to A1, A3, A5, C1 and C3 (in that order) in slot 5, containing dilution buffer.
2. Once all samples are transferred to dilution buffer, *total volume of samples* will be added from slot 5 to Visby.

Explanation of adjustable parameters below:
* `P1000 Single GEN2 Mount`: Select which mount (left, right) the pipette is attached to.
* `Sample Volume (µL)`: Specify the volume (in µL) that should be transferred to the Visby. This volume will be transferred to the dilution buffer, before being transferred to the Visby.
* `Number of Samples`: Select the number of samples to test (1-5).
