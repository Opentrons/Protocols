### Protocol Steps
1. 125 uL of recovery agent is added to samples
2. 2 minute delay until a biphasic mixture is attained
3. Visual inspection should occur of the biphasic mixture then resume is selected in the app.
4. Recovery agent is removed from the samples, leaving only a clear liquid in the wells
5. 35 uL of pre-amplification mix is added to the samples
6. Samples are moved to a PCR strip tube prior to thermocycler step as outlined in procedure documentation


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
