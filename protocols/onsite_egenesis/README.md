## Description
For a detailed description of this protocol, please refer to the [Nanoporo Direct RNA sequencing (SQK-RNA002) SOP](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/onsite_egenesis/direct-rna-sequencing-sqk-rna002-DRS_9080_v2_revO_14Aug2019-minion+(2).pdf).

Note: wash buffer should be split evenly between wells A5 and A6 on slot 5.

### Protocol Steps
1. Make mix 1.
2. Distribute mix to RNA tubes.
3. Make mix 2.
4. Distribute to rna tubes.
5. Add reverse transcriptase.
6. Transfer sample to plate.
7. Pause for user to thermocycle sample plate.
8. Transfer beads to plate.
9. Mix samples, aspirate sample into tip, incubate at top of the well for 1 minutes, repeat 4 times.
10. Remove supernatant.
11. Add ethanol to samples.
12. Remove supernatant.
13. Add nuclease free water.
14. Transfer to fresh column (column 3).
15. Make and distribute 3rd mix.
16. Transfer beads to plate.
17. Remove supernatant.
18. Add wash buffer.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
