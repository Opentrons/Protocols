# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
    * qPCR setup

## Description
Reformat up to four 96 well plates into a 384 well PCR plate for downstream qPCR. This protocol will also add mastermix to the necessary wells and then transfer patient samples to the corresponding wells.

**Deck Setup**

**Note**: A full run with 4 plates with a master mix transfer volume of 10 uL will require 3,760 uL of master mix. This is divided into 3 tubes in the picture above. There is a parameter below that asks for the `Master Mix Volume per Tube`. By default this is set to 1400 uL (**Recommendation: Always add more than 1400 uL to prevent aspirating air**) in order to account for dead volume. You can adjust this as needed and the protocol will automatically determine how many tubes it needs. 

**For Example**: If the `Master Mix Volume per Tube` is set to 1000 uL the protocol will determine 4 tubes are needed (A1, B1, C1, D1) with at least 1000 uL in each tube for a run with four full plates. The last tube does not require a full 1000 uL volume; it would need a bit more than the difference (~760 uL). 

**Protocol Steps**

1. Transfer 10 uL of Master Mix from A1 of the Tube Rack to A1 of the 384 well plate.
`Step 1 will repeat for all samples into the corresponding wells using the same tip.`
2. Transfer 10 uL of patient sample from A1 of Plate 1 to A1 of the 384 Well PCR plate.
`Step 2 will repeat for all patient samples into the corresponding wells using a new tip each time.`

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
