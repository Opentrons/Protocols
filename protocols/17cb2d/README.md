# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol fills [Applied Biosystems MicroAmp 384-well plates]([https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4343370#/4343370) with mastermix. **Update**: this protocol can now accomodate the SSI 384-well plate as well.</br>
</br>
The protocol can fill up to 9 plates and will dispense 7.5µL of mastermix 1 into all the odd rows (A/C/E...) and 7.5µL of mastermix 2 into all the even rows (B/D/F...).</br>
</br>
This protocol has been updated to use the GEN2 Multi-Channel Pipettes - please use corresponding tips.</br>
</br>
**Update 09-21-20:** The protocol will now do a blow out in the well and aspirate 2µL of air at the top of the well after each dispense step to ensure all liquid has been expelled from pipette and minimize contamination risk due to droplet hang.</br>
</br>
**Update 09-25-20:** The protocol has been updated in two ways. First, the mastermix should be split between two wells (A1/A2 and A11/A12). Second, after aspirating the mastermix, the pipette will move to the sides of the well to remove liquid attached to the tips.</br>
</br>
**Update 10-29-20:** The protocol will now transfer 10µL of mastermix.</br>
</br>
**Update 10-30-20:** The protocol will now multi-dispense mastermix instead of 1-to-1 transfer. </br>
</br>
**Update 11-12-20:** The protocol now has a new parameter for master mix volume (default is 7.5µL)
