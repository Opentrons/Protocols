# NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina: E7770S Section 1 with Poly(A) Isolation using Oligo-dT Beads: Part-2 - cDNA Synthesis

### Author

# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina

## Description
This protocol uses multi-channel P20 and P300 pipettes to perform library prep steps on 8-48 input total RNA samples according to the attached NEB user guide. This is part-2 of a six part process (first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis). Reagents are combined into two mixtures (mix1 is composed of water + first strand enzyme mix, mix2 is composed of second strand reaction buffer + second strand enzyme mix + water)  to reduce the number of transfer steps. A user-specified parameter is available to specify the number of samples in the current run.

### Protocol Steps
1. Use settings in the OT app to pre-cool the temperature modules to 4 degrees C prior to running this protocol.
2. The protocol will alert the user to ensure reagents are present on deck in sufficient volume.
3. The p20 multi will add 10 uL mix1 (water + first strand enzyme mix) to the fragmented, primed poly(A) RNA samples and and mix.
4. The OT-2 will pause for an off-deck incubation.
5. The p300 multi will add 60 uL mix2 (second strand reaction buffer + second strand enzyme mix + water) to the first strand reaction and mix.
6. The OT-2 will finish part-2 notifying the user to proceed with an off-deck incubation.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters using the parameters section on this page, then download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
3. Set up your deck and run labware position check using the OT App. For tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
4. Hit 'Run'.
