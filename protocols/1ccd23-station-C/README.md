# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol creates a custom qPCR prep protocol for Covid-19 diagnostics. The input into this protocol is an elution plate of purified RNA, and the output is a PCR plate containing the samples mixed with mastermix.
Using a [Single-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette), this protocol will begin by creating reaction mix in a 2ml tube. The mix is then distributed to a PCR strip. Then, using the [Multi-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette), samples will be transferred from their plate to the qPCR plate and mixed with the reaction mix.

If you have any questions about this protocol, please email our Applications Engineering team at [protocols@opentrons.com](mailto:protocols@opentrons.com).
