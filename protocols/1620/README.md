## Process
1. Upload your CSV file, select the mount for your P10 pipette, and select your destination tube type
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".
7. The specified volume of each sample will be transferred to the destination pooling tube. For small volumes (<10Âµl), a touch tip is performed at the source tube. Only non-zero entries are transferred to conserve tips and time.
