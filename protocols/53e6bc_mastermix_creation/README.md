## Description
This protocol performs custom mastermix creation from antibodies. The volumes of each antibody per sample to be transferred from a custom deepwell plate to the mastermix tube are specfied in a `.csv` input file, formatted as follows:

```
Volume per antibody(in ul),Antibody,Well
2.2,CD3 BUV395,A1
1.1,CD45 BUV496,A3
1.1,CD15 BUV563,A5
1.1,CD45RA BUV615,A7
2.2,CD14 BUV661,A9
0.55,CD8 BUV737,A11
2.2,CD11c BUV805,B2
1.1,CD25 BV421,B4
0.55,CD4 BV480,B6
2.2,CD16 BV605,B8
2.2,CD123 BV650,B10
2.2,CD127 BV711,B12
2.2,IgD BV750,C1

## Process
1. Input the respective mount sides for your P300 and P10 single-channel pipettes, the number of samples, and the antibody .csv file.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
