# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep


## Description
This protocol performs the end prep for cDNA in the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit.
Reaction buffer and enzyme mix are added to samples before mixing. The sample plate is then moved to
an off-deck thermocycler.

### Protocol Steps
0. Temperature module cools down to 4 C
1. 10 uL of reaction buffer and enzyme mix is added to each sample
2. Samples with buffer and enzyme mix added are mixed via pipetting
3. OT-2 flashes on completion


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
