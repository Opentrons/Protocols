## Description
This protocol sets up a DRG<sup>TM</sup> TSH ELISA for a 96 well plate. For background
information please visit this [link](https://www.sceti.co.jp/images/psearch/pdf/DRG_EIA1782_p.pdf).
---
The samples will be located in a 2 mL tuberack.
The standards and other reagents are located in a 15+50mL tuberack

1. Secure the desired number of coated wells in the holder.
2. Dispense 100 µL of standards, specimens, and controls into appropriate wells.
3. Dispense 100 µL of Enzyme Conjugate Reagent into each well.
4. Thoroughly mix for 30 seconds. It is very important to mix them completely.
5. Incubate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 60 minutes.
6. Remove the incubation mixture by flicking plate contents into a waste container.
7. Rinse and flick the microtiter wells 5 times with distilled or deionized water. (Please do not use tap water.)
8. Strike the wells sharply onto absorbent paper or paper towels to remove all residual water droplets.
9. Dispense 100 µL of TMB Reagent into each well. Gently mix for 10 seconds.
10. Incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.
11. Stop the reaction by adding 100 µL of Stop Solution to each well.
12. Gently mix for 30 seconds. It is important to make sure that all the blue color changes to yellow color
completely.
13. Read absorbance at 450 nm with a microtiter well reader within 15 minutes.

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](http://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your tiprack, pipette, and labware using the OT app. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/getting-started/software-setup/calibrating-the-pipettes).
5. Hit "run" and watch your robot do the rest!
