# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol automates GNA Octea prep. Using the [P300 Multi-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette) and the [P300 Single-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette), all the reagents necessary for the sample prep are transferred to the samples and the samples are incubated on the [Temperature Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/tempdeck) and [Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck). Once all sample prep has been completed, the samples are transferred to a custom plate containing the labware needed to test the samples on the [GNA analyzer](https://www.gna-bio.com/products/).

This protocol is still a work in progress and will be updated.

### Protocol Steps
1. The protocol begins with the Single-Channel Pipette transferring 10µL of Magnetic Beads to the 8 samples. The Magnetic Beads are mixed before aspiration and RS1 is added if selected above. The same tip is used for all transfers.
2. The Single-Channel Pipette picks up a tip, transfers 680µL HB1 (170µL, 4x) to the sample, mixes 10 times, performs a touch tip, then drops tip in waste (for each sample).
3. The Temperature Module is set to 80C and the protocol delays for 3 minutes (incubation).
4. The Temperature Module is set to 56C. While the Temperature Module is cooling, the Single-Channel Pipette will mix the samples.
5. After a 3 minute incubation at 56C, the Single-Channel Pipette will transfer samples to the Deepwell Plate on the Magnetic Module
6. The Magnetic Module will engage and the protocol will delay for 2 minutes (incubation). After the delay, the Multi-Channel Pipette will transfer the supernatant (160µL, 5x) to A1 of the 12-Well Reservoir.
7. The Multi-Channel Pipette, using new tips, will transfer 200µl of WB1 and mix 12 times.
8. Again, the Magnetic Module will engage and the protocol will delay for 2 minutes (incubation). After the delay, the Multi-Channel Pipette will transfer the supernatant (200µL) to A1 of the 12-Well Reservoir.
9. The Single-Channel Pipette, using a single tip, will transfer 40µL of PCA to each of the sample wells in the Deepwell Plate, reconstituting the PCA beforehand if selected.
10. Using a new tip for each sample, the Single-Channel Pipette will mix the sample and transfer 40µL to the GNA Octea well.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions), if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
