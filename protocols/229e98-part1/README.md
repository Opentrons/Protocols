	* Distribution


## Description
This protocol is part 1 of 2-part protocol designed to transfer biofluids and add the necessary reagents for preparation. In this part, The biofluids are distributed from cryovials to centrifuge tubes and two solutions are added. The samples are then transferred to a Nanosep 3k Ultrafiltration tube in preparation of centrifugation. See below for deck and reagent setup.
