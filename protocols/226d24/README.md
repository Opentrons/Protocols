# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep


## Description
This protocol automates a PCR prep involving uniquely barcoded forward primers and can accommodate 1-96 samples.</br>
</br>
The protocol begins with the creation of a reaction mix (water, mastermix, and reverse primers) and distribution of that reaction mix. Following this, uniquely barcoded forward primers are transferred to corresponding wells of the PCR plate containing the reaction mix. Finally, samples are transferred in a similar manner from a deep well plate to the PCR plate.
