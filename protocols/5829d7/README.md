# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
200ul of viral transport media (VTM) is reformatted from (up to) 96 tubes split amongst 3 tube racks to a  96 well plate. Tubes are reformatted by row in tube racks 1 (slot 1), 2 (slot 4), and then 3 (slot 7).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify the number of samples for this run.
* `Tube Aspiration Height`: Specify the aspiration height in the tubes. Default is 1mm.
* `Well Dispense Height`: Specify the dispense height in the wells. Default is 1mm.
* `Aspirate/Dispense Flow rate`: Specify the aspirate/dispense flow rate in the wells. Default is 274ul/sec.
* `P1000 Single-Channel Mount`: Specify (left) or (right) mount for the P1000 single channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pick up tip
2. Aspirate 200ul of VTM
3. Dispense 200ul of VTM
4. Drop tip
5. 1-4 repeated by row in the tube racks.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
