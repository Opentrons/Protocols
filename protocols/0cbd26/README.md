It is crucial that the header of the csv is exactly in that order. The user can specify up to 3 slots for the for the source racks (Falcon racks, slots 1, 2, and 3), and up to 3 slots for the destination racks (CGE racks, slots 4, 5, 6). The user must specify how many racks of each are on the deck at the start of the run, and put the racks in order of numerical lowest to highest (i.e. slots 4, and 5 for only two destination racks on the deck).
