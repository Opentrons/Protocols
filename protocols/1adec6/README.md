# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Proteins & Proteomics
	* Assay

## Description
This protocol now utilizes the [P20 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette) (instead of the P300), uses additional plates, and has modified liquid handling. The steps of this updated version can be found below.

**Updated Sept 29, 2021**</br>
This protocol has been updated based on feedback from the user. User can now select **None** when selecting a "**Number of Destination Plates**" (skipping the aliquoting step). Additionally, this update fixes an issue with the way tips are handled when using less than 8 tips with the multi-channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Destination plate, [P20 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette): Add **Destination plate PBS volume** of PBS ([NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-12-well-reservoir-15-ml), Row 2) into columns 1-4 rows A-H, column 5 rows A-E (will access new tips for last transfer).
2. Destination plate, [P20 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette): Add **Destination plate 66% DMSO volume** of 66% DMSO ([NEST 12-Well Reservoir, 15mL](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-12-well-reservoir-15-ml), Row 1) into columns 6-9 rows A-H, column 10 rows A-E (will access new tips for last transfer).
3. Source plate, [P20 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette): Take **Source plate volume for dilution** of column 1-4 rows A-H, column 5 rows A-E, and transfer into the destination plate in the same orientation (columns 1-4 rows A-H, column 5 rows A-E). Replace tips between columns.

- Take **Library aliquot volume** of column A rows A-H of the prepared library plate and add to
column A rows A-H in empty plate 1
- Take **Library aliquot volume** of column A rows A-H of the prepared library plate and add to
column A rows A-H in empty plate 2 (if using)
- Take **Library aliquot volume** of column A rows A-H of the prepared library plate and add to
column A rows A-H in empty plate 3 (if using)
Replace tips and repeat these steps for columns 2-10 (Replace tips between columns)
