# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Illumina RNA Prep with Enrichment

## Description

This protocol performs normalization for the [Illimuina RNA Prep with Enrichment](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/rna-prep-enrichment.html) protocol. Normalization is the method of adding buffer to a set of samples so that their concentrations are uniform. This is usually so that they can be treated uniformly in subsequent steps. For example, after NGS library prep of multiple samples, the samples are normalized to the same concentration, so that the same volume of each sample can be pooled, and each sample is represented in equal proportions. A requirement for this Normalization protocol is that the concentrations and volumes are known i.e. previously quantified by Picogreen and aliquoted into a plate at a set volume, and formatted
in a .csv file as input.

You should upload a .csv file formatted in the following way, being sure to include the header line:

```
Sample_Plate,Sample_well,InitialVol,InitialConc,TargetConc
sample_plate,A1,20,2.3,2
sample_plate,B1,20,3.99,2
sample_plate,C1,20,4.39,2
sample_plate,D1,20,3.95,2
sample_plate,E1,20,4.16,2
sample_plate,F1,20,3.81,2
sample_plate,G1,20,3.96,2
sample_plate,H1,20,3.41,2
```

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
