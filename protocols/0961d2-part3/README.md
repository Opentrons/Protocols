## Description
This protocol is part 3 of a 4-part protocol designed to accomplish the Sample-Barcoding Module of the [plexWell 384 Low Pass Library Preparation](https://seqwell.com/products/plexwell-lp-384/).


[Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part1)
[Part 2](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part2)
[Part 3](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part3)
[Part 4](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part4)


This protocol performs the first half of Step 3 (SB Pooling). During this protocol, 1-4 SBP96 plates from [Part 2](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part2) can be loaded on to the deck of the OT-2. Every six columns from the SBP96 plates are pooled into one column of a clean, 96-well plate (columns 1-6 of SBP96 plate 1 are pooled into column 1 of clean plate; columns 7-12 of SBP96 plate 1 are pooled into column 2 of clean plate; columns 1-6 of SBP96 plate 2 are pooled into column 3 of clean plate, etc).
