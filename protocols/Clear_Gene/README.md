## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your tiprack, pipette, and labware using the OT app. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-one/getting-started-software-setup/calibrating-the-pipettes).
5. Hit "run".
6. Robot transfers 36 uL from column 1 of temperature module #1 to column 5.
7. Robot transfers 45 uL from col 2 of temperature module #1 to col 5.
8. Robot transfers 4.5 uL of template to mastermix tubes.
9. Robot transfers 4.5 uL of primers to mastermix tubes. 
10. Robot mixes mastermix tubes. 
11. Robot transfers mastermix to 96 well plate on temperatuer module #2.

### Additional Notes
Process up to four (4) 96 deep well plates of sample at a time. Control pipette aspirate and dispense speeds to adjust flow rates.
