# TALEN-Protocol
Opentrons TALEN protocol:
  All files from TALEN protocol developed during summer of 2017 for Opentrons, Labworks, Inc.

The full protocol with all the progress I had made is found in the TALENProtocol.ipynb file. 

The code for this protocol is fairly well-documented within the file. It has the option for csv input or hard-coded input if desired.
The TALEN strings and other variables are hard-coded variables at the top of the code but could easily be inputted via csv with slight modification to the code.
