## Description
This protocol is designed for running tests with the Arcis Blood Kit (further instructions about the protocol can be found [here](http://www.arcisbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arcis-Blood-kit-Bulk-kit-UFL005-50rxn-IFU-Rev-6.12.2018.pdf)). With the Arcis Blood Kit, nucleic acid investigations can be performed easily and efficiently with the two included reagents. This protocol calls for the use of a P50-Single and P300-Single pipettes, as well as Opentrons Tube Racks, Corning 96-well, 360μL flat plate, and two Bioplastics 100μL plates.
