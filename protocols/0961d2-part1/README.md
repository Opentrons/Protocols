## Description
This protocol is part 1 of a 4-part protocol designed to accomplish the Sample-Barcoding Module of the [plexWell 384 Low Pass Library Preparation](https://seqwell.com/products/plexwell-lp-384/).


[Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part1)
[Part 2](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part2)
[Part 3](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part3)
[Part 4](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part4)


This protocol accomplishes Step 1 (Sample-Barcoding, SB, Reaction Set-up). During this protocol, 6µL of input DNA in each well of two 96-well plates is transferred to the SBP96 plate containing specific reagents. 5µL of Coding Buffer (3X) is then added to each well of the SBP96 plate.
