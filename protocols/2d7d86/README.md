## Description
This protocols preps a 384 plate for qPCR processing. 1-14 samples can be selected. If running less than 14 samples, the protocol will pick up the correct number of tips (less than 8) to dispense across all columns in the 384 well plate. Tips are exchanged per source column in the 96 well plate.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Tip pickup starting column (1-12)`: Specify which column (1-12) of the tiprack to start picking up tips. If "3" is selected, then the tip pickup will start on column 3 of the tip rack. Please ensure the starting tip column and the following tip column are full (16 tips between the selected column and the column after).
* `P20 Multi-Channel Pipette Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 Multi-Channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pipette picks up number of tips with multi-channel pipette in accordance with number of samples from source column in source plate.
2. Pipette transfers 10ul from source plate to all columns in destination plate according to plate map.
3. Pipette drops tips and proceeds to next source column if needed.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
