# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Protein Purification
	* Protein A, Pro Plus, Pro Plus LX Columns

## Description
This protocol (Plate Prep) performs pipetting to transfer reagents (equilibration buffer, wash buffer 1, wash buffer 2 and elution buffer) from a 12-well reagent stock reservoir to 96-well V-bottom plates (the reagent plates) on the OT-2. These reagent plates are used for the protein purification protocol of Phytip® Protein A, ProPlus or ProPlus LX Columns.

The protocol is developed to prepare sufficient reagents to process up to 96 samples (a full 96-well plate).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify number of samples (1-96) for this run.
* `P300 Multi-Channel Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 Multi-Channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Equilibration buffer from reagent stock reservoir (slot 8) is transferred to the “Equilibration” plate (slot 9) by the 8-channel pipette (200 uL per well).
2. Wash buffer 1 from reagent stock reservoir (slot 8) is transferred to the “1st wash” plate (slot 5) by the 8-channel pipette (200 uL per well).
3. Wash buffer 2 from reagent stock reservoir (slot 8) is transferred to the “2nd wash” plate (slot 7) by the 8-channel pipette (200 uL per well).
4. Elution buffer from reagent stock reservoir (slot 8) is transferred to the “Elution” plate (slot 11) by the 8-channel pipette (80 uL per well).


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
