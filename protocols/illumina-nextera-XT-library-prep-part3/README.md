## Description
Part 3 of 4: Normalize Libraries

* [Part 2: Clean Up Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part2) 
* [Part 3: Normalize Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part3) 
* [Part 4: Pool Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part4)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit protocol describe by the [Illumina Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_nextera/nextera-xt/nextera-xt-library-prep-reference-guide-15031942-03.pdf).

This is part 3 of the protocol, which is step (4) of the overall workflow: normalize libraries. This step normalizes the concentration of each library to ensure correct library representation in the donwstream pooled libraries.

It is safe to stop after this step and re-start work at a later point. If you are stopping, seal the plate and store at -25°C to -15°C for up to seven days.

## Process
1. Input your number of samples (make sure it is consistent with part 1, and 2).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
