## Description
Part 3 of 4: Normalize Libraries

* [Part 1: Tagment and Amplify](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part1)
* [Part 2: Clean Up Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part2)
* [Part 3: Normalize Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part3)
* [Part 4: Pool Libraries](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part4)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit protocol describe by the [Illumina Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_nextera/nextera-xt/nextera-xt-library-prep-reference-guide-15031942-03.pdf).

This is part 3 of the protocol, which is step (4) of the overall workflow: normalize libraries. This step normalizes the concentration of each library to ensure correct library representation in the donwstream pooled libraries.

It is safe to stop after this step and re-start work at a later point. If you are stopping, seal the plate and store at -25°C to -15°C for up to seven days.

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

This protocol requires specific labware in a specific set-up.

Slot 1: [Bio-Rad Plate](https://labware.opentrons.com/biorad_96_wellplate_200ul_pcr?category=wellPlate) (clean and empty); final elution will be transferred to this plate.

Slot 2: [USA Scientific 12-Channel Reservoir](https://labware.opentrons.com/usascientific_12_reservoir_22ml?category=reservoir)
* A1: Library Normalization Additive 1 (LNA1)
* A2: Library Normalization Beads 1 (LNB1)
* A3: Library Normalization Wash 1 (LNW1)
* A4: Library Normalization Storage Buffer 1 (LNS1)
* A5: 0.1 N NaOH
* A6: Empty - LNA1 & LNB1 will be combined here
* A12: Liquid Waste

Slot 4: [Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) with [Bio-Rad Plate](https://labware.opentrons.com/biorad_96_wellplate_200ul_pcr?category=wellPlate) (clean and empty)

Slot 5: [Bio-Rad Plate](https://labware.opentrons.com/biorad_96_wellplate_200ul_pcr) containing samples from [Part 2](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part2)

Slot 7: [Opentrons Tip Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/opentrons-300ul-tips)

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* Pipette Model: Select which pipette (P50/P300) you will use for this protocol.
* Pipette Mount: Specify which mount your single-channel pipette is on (left or right).
* Number of Samples: Select the number of samples (1-96) to be run in the protocol. NOTE ~ selecting 24 or less samples will result in only the top-left corner of the plates being used (A1 - D6).




### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2

### Modules
* [Magnetic Module](https://opentrons.com/modules)

### Reagents
* [Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/nextera-xt-dna.html)

## Process
1. Select all desired settings according to the “Setup” section above to customize your protocol run.
NOTE ~ "Number of Samples" should be the same as [Part 1](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part1) and [Part 2](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/illumina-nextera-XT-library-prep-part2)
2. Download your customized OT-2 protocol using the blue “Download” button, located above the deckmap.
3. Upload your protocol into the Opentrons App and follow the instructions there to set up your deck, calibrate your labware, and proceed to run.
4. Make sure to add reagents to your labware before placing it on the deck! Your reagents should be in your reservoir, and the samples you’re starting with should be in your plate in slot 5 on the deck.


### Additional Notes
If you’d like to request a protocol supporting multiple plates or require other changes to this script, please fill out our [Protocol Request Form](https://opentrons-protocol-dev.paperform.co/). You can also modify the Python file directly by following our [API Documentation](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/apiv2index.html). If you’d like to chat with an applications engineer about changes, please contact us at [protocols@opentrons.com](mailto:protocols@opentrons.com).
