## Description
This protocol sets up experiments for [Septum](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/product7/132/z553905.tif/_jcr_content/renditions/z553905-medium.jpg) plates of which the
STLs can be found [here](https://github.com/Opentrons/otone_hardware/tree/master/models).
* Step-by-step -
Step 2: Charge with 30uL of clean solvent (hexane) from first row of the trough (or 1A tube from tube rack if using single channel pipette) then dispense the solvent over trash (this step is just for rinsing the pipette tip).

Step 3: Charge the pipette with 30uL of work solution from the second row of the trough (or 2A tube from tube rack if using single channel pipette ). (Same tips from step 2)

Step 4: Dispense 20uL  of work solution to the first row of the custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons. In the pipette should remain 10uL of work solution.
Obs: In case of using the single channel pipette the 20uL should be dispensed to 1A position of custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons.
As mention above, in the pipette should remain 10uL of work solution. (Same tips from step 2)

Step 5 (Important): Charge the pipette with 20uL of work solution from the second row of the trough (or 2A tube from tube rack if using single channel pipette ).
The pipette will be charged again with 30uL of work solution. (Same tips from step 2)

Step 6: Dispense 20uL of work solution to the second row of the custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons. Once again should remain 10uL of work solution in the pipette. (Same tips from step 2)
Obs: In case of using the single channel pipette, the 20uL should be dispensed to 2A position of custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons.(Same tips from step 2)

Step 7: Repeat Step 5. (Same tips from step 2)

Step 8: Repeat Step 6 until fill each row of the custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons. Configuration of the custom-made septum plate is 6X8. (Same tips from step 2)
Obs: In case of using the single channel pipette repeat Step 6 until fill all the positions of custom-made septum plate designed by Opentrons. (Same tips from step 2)

Step 9: Once finished to fill the custom-made septum plate. The 10uL of the work solution remained in the pipette should be dispensed back on the second row of the trough (or 2A tube from tube rack if using single channel pipette).

Step 10: Drop tips after finishing Step 9.
