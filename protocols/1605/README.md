## Description
This protocol performs PCR preparation on 4 custom 96-well PCR plates. DNA samples are contained in a PCR plate mounted on an aluminum block on an Opentrons temperature module. For reagent setup, see 'Additional Notes' below.

## Process
1. Input your number of sample columns to be processed.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".
7. The temperature module with DNA samples mounted cools to 4ËšC. The program resumes after the temperature is reached.
8. 22ul of mastermixes 1-4 in the 12-channel trough are distributed to each specified sample column of PCR plates 1-4, in slots 2, 3, 5, and 6, respectively. Tips are refreshed for each mastermix.
9. 3ul of DNA sample is transferred to its corresponding well in each of the 4 PCR plates. Contents are mixed 5x and tips are changed after each transfer.

### Additional Notes
12-channel trough setup:  
* Mastermix 1: channel 1
* Mastermix 2: channel 2
* Mastermix 3: channel 3
* Mastermix 4: channel 4
