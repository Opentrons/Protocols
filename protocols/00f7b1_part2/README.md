## Description
This protocol is part 2 of a 10 part series. Please look at deck map and liquid legend below. Note: bead strip tubes can accommodate 2 columns of sample by volume (i.e. 6 columns of beads for a full plate of samples). The RNA wash can accommodate 3 columns of sample per column of wash. There only needs to be one column of strand primer mix per run for all sample numbers. An overage of at least 10% should be used each run.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
