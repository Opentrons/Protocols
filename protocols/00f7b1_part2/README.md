# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories

	* NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep


## Description
This protocol is part 2 of a 10 part series. Please look at deck map and liquid legend below. Note: bead strip tubes can accommodate 2 columns of sample by volume (i.e. 6 columns of beads for a full plate of samples). The RNA binding buffer can accommodate 3 columns of sample per column of wash. There only needs to be one column of strand primer mix per run for all sample numbers. An overage of at least 10% should be used each run.

11. Magnet module engaged
12. Supernatant removed
13. Final wash
14. Remove supernatant
15. Master mix elution added to sample
16. Protocol pause

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
