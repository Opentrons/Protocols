* [Part 2: PCR Enrichment of Adaptor-ligated DNA](./1503-dr-travis-glenn-lab-uga-ehs-part2)
* [Part 3: Cleanup of PCR Reaction](./1503-dr-travis-glenn-lab-uga-ehs-part3)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit protocol for use with inputs ≥ 100 ng, described by the [Instructional Manual](https://www.neb.com/protocols/2017/10/25/protocol-for-use-with-inputs-greater-100-ng-e7805-e6177).

This is part 3 of the protocol, which includes (2.4) Cleanup of PCR Reaction.

After these two steps, the samples need to be stored at -20°C.

You will need:
* P300 Multi-channel Pipette
* P50 Multi-channel Pipette
* [Opentrons Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/magdeck)
* Bio-rad Hardshell Full-skirted 96-well PCR Plates
* 96-well Deep Well Microplate
* 12-column Trough
* 200/300 uL Tips


### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Modules

### Reagents

## Process
1. Input the number of columns your samples occupy in the sample plate (8 samples in a column).
2. Select your tip racks.
3. Download your protocol.
4. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map, and see Additional Notes for reagent setup.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
7. Hit "Run".


### Additional Notes
Deep Well Plate:

* Speedbeads: column 1

Reagents placed in the deep well plate will be distributed using the multichannel pipette, so fill the entire column (all 8 tubes) with the same amount of reagent.

12-column Trough:

* Ethanol: A1
