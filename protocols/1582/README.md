## Description
This protocol performs vape cartridge oil filling from a reservoir mounted on a temperature module to a custom 6x8 cartridge adapter. The protocol allows for the user to input the number of cartridges to fill, volume of oil with which to fill each cartridge, pipette mount side, and oil temperature to be heated to.

Please calibrate the pipette tip to the cartridge in the orientation shown in 'Additional Notes' below. It is very important that each cartridge is seated properly so that the dispenses land in the cartridge and not on the outside walls.
