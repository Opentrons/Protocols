## Description
This protocol is part 4 of a 4-part protocol designed to accomplish the Sample-Barcoding Module of the [plexWell 384 Low Pass Library Preparation](https://seqwell.com/products/plexwell-lp-384/).


[Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part1)
[Part 2](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part2)
[Part 3](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part3)
[Part 4](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part4)


This protocol performs the second half of Step 3 (SB Pooling). During this protocol, each column of the destination plate in [Part 3](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part3) is pooled into a 2mL DNA LoBind tube. The user has the option to pool up to 12 columns (the entire plate) into individual tubes for each column.
