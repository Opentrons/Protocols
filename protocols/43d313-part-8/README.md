## Description

With this 9 part workflow, the OT-2 will follow [ArcBio Continuous RNA Workflow - Pre-PCR Instrument and Post-PCR Instrument experimental protocol](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/43d313/ArcBio_RNA_Workflow_020922.xlsx) to convert up to 96 input RNA samples into cDNA libraries. This is Part 8 of 9: This OT-2 protocol uses the RNA Continuous Workflow, Post-PCR Instrument section of attached experimental protocol to perform library QC setup steps.

## Protocol Steps

This is part 8 of 9 parts: Library QC.

Set up: Place Twin Tec 200 uL PCR plate with libraries on the Temperature Module (at room temperature) in deck slot 3. Place the Agilent Tapestation plate on the Magnetic Module in deck slot 1. Reservoir nest_12_reservoir_15ml in deck slot 5 (A1 - Qubit solution). Reagents in strip tubes on 96-well aluminum block opentrons_96_aluminumblock_generic_pcr_strip_200ul (column 1 - Tapestation reagent) in deck slot 2. Place Opentrons 20 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_20ul in deck slots 10, 11 and Opentrons 200 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_200ul in deck slots 7, 8.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps using the p20 multi- and p300 multi-channel pipettes, temperature module and magnetic module:
1. Use the p20 multi to transfer Tapestation reagent to the Tapestation plate on the Magnetic Module.
2. Pause to prompt the user to place Qubit 8-tube Flex Strips on the Aluminum Block.
3. Use the p20 multi to transfer 2 uL of libaries to each of Qubit 8-tube Flex Strips and the Agilent 96-well Tapestation plate. Mix.
3. Use the p300 multi to transfer 198 uL Qubit solution from the reservoir to the Qubit 8-tube Flex Strips. Mix.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Use the protocol parameters on this page to make any needed adjustments to the number of samples, well bottom clearances, engage height and time for the deep well plate on the magnetic module, the magnitude of the move used to target and avoid the bead pellet, number of minutes for bead drying.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
5. Hit "Run".
