### Protocol Steps
1. Transfer 2.4 uL from DMSO reservoir to columns 2-12 in Dilution Plates DMSO 1-1+2-1 , keep tips (variable step)
2. Transfer 2.4 uL from DMSO reservoir to all wells in Dilution Plates DMSO 1-2+2-2, discard tips (variable step)
Optional predilution step, dilute compounds in columns 1 and/or 2 with DMSO by a specified factor into columns 11/12 for a total volume of 20 uL (variable step)
3. Transfer 7.2 uL from column 1 of Compound Stocks to column 1 or column 11 if predilution takes place of Dilution Plate DMSO 1-1, keep tips
4. Transfer 4.8 uL from column 1 of Dilution plate DMSO 1-1 to column 2, mixing after. Repeat process, transferring from 2-3 3-4 4-5 etc mixing after each time, until transferring from 10-11 (skip 12), keep tips
5. Transfer 4.8 uL from column 11 of Dilution plate DMSO 1-1 to column 1 of Dilution Plate DMSO 1-2, mixing after, keep tips.
6. Transfer 4.8 uL from column 1 of Dilution plate DMSO 1-2 to column 2, mixing after. Repeat process, transferring from 2-3 3-4 4-5 etc mixing after each time, until transferring from 10-11 (skip 12), discard tips
7. Repeat steps 4-8 for column 2/12 of compound stocks and Dilution Plate DMSO 2-1+2-2
8. Manual tip box replacement.
9. Transfer 2.4 uL from each column of Dilution Plate DMSO 1-1 to the same column of Media Plate 1-1, discarding tips after each transfer.
10. Manual tip box replacement.
11. Repeat steps 10-11 for Dilution Plates DMSO/Media Plates 1-2, 2-1, 2-2
