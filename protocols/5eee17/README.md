### Protocol Steps
1. Both pipettes pick up 1000µL tip
2. Pipette 1 aspirates 700µL from tube at position 1 on rack 1 with air gap
3. Pipette 2 aspirates 700µL from tube at position 2 on rack 1 with air gap
4. Pipette 1 dispenses full volume into tube at position 1 on rack 3
5. Pipette 1 mixes using 1000µL volume 5x
6. Pipette 1 aspirates 800 µL from mixed dilution tube
7. Pipette 1 dispenses full volume into vial at position 1 on HPLC rack at deck position 11
8. Pipette 2 dispenses full volume into tube at position 2 on rack 3
9. Pipette 2 mixes using 1000µL volume 5x
10. Pipette 2 aspirates 800 µL from mixed dilution tube
11. Pipette 2 dispenses full volume into vial at position 2 on HPLC rack at deck position 11
12. Pipette 1&2 discard tips in waste tray
13. Steps 1-12 are repeated for as many samples as specified, pausing for refills if more than 48 samples are input.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
