* Hydrogen Peroxide

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. Robot will transfer 50 uL cells from column 1 of deep well block in slot 3 to columns 7 and 12 of plate in slot 5.
7. Robot will transfer 50 uL cells from column 7 of deep well block in slot 3 to columns 7 and 12 of plate in slot 6.
8. Robot will transfer 50 uL cells from column 1 of deep well block in slot 4 to columns 7 and 12 of plate in slot 7.
9. Robot will transfer 50 uL cells from column 7 of deep well block in slot 4 to columns 7 and 12 of plate in slot 8.
10. Robot will transfer H2O2 from well A6 to wells A1-A5, A7-A11 of deep well block in slot 3.
11. Robot will transfer H2O2 from well A6 to wells A1-A5, A7-A11 of deep well block in slot 4.
12. Robot will transfer cells from column 1 of deep well block in slot 3 to column 1-2 of plate in slot 5.
13. Robot will transfer cells from column 2 of deep well block in slot 3 to column 3-4 of plate in slot 5.
14. Robot will transfer cells from column 3 of deep well block in slot 3 to column 5-6 of plate in slot 5.
15. Robot will transfer cells from column 4 of deep well block in slot 3 to column 8-9 of plate in slot 5.
16. Robot will transfer cells from column 5 of deep well block in slot 3 to column 10-11 of plate in slot 5.
17. Robot will continue to transfer cells from deep well block in slot 3 to plate in slot 6 in the same manner as steps 12-16.
18. Robot will repeat the same process from steps 12-17 for deep block in slot 4 and plates in slot 7, 8.
