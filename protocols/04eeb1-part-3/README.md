## Description
The Illumina COVIDSeq Test is a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing test that is used fo detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This protocol is the third part of a seven part protocol that is run on the OT-2 for this kit.

* Part 1: [Anneal RNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1)
* Part 2: [Synthesize First Strand cDNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-2)
* Part 3: [Amplify cDNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-3)
* Part 4: [Tagment PCR Amplicons](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-4)
* Part 5: [Post Tagmentation Clean Up](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-5)
* Part 6: [Amplify Tagmented Amplicons](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-6)
* Part 7: [Pool and Clean Up Libraries](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-7)

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `P300 Multichannel GEN2 Pipette Mount`: Choose the mount position of your P300 Multichannel pipette, either left or right.
* `Plate 1 Columns`: Choose which columns master mix should be added on plate 1. Separate column numbers with a comman (Ex: 1,2,3,4).
* `Plate 2 Columns`: Choose which columns master mix should be added on plate 2. Separate column numbers with a comman (Ex: 1,2,3,4).
* `Temperature (C)`: Choose the temperature the temperature module should be set at in the beginning of the protocol.
* `Plate 1 Master Mix Column`: Choose the column on the 12-channel reservoir for the master mix for Plate 1.
* `Plate 2 Master Mix Column`: Choose the column on the 12-channel reservoir for the master mix for Plate 2.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pick up tips from Opentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 µL on Slot 10
2. Aspirate 200 uL from Column 1 (A1) of Master Mix Reservoir
3. Dispense 20 uL into Column 1 (A1) of Plate 1 on Slot 11

**Steps 3 will repeat for the entire plate.**

4. Drop tips into Opentrons Fixed Trash Bin

**Plate 2 Begins**

5. Pick up tips from Opentrons 96 Filter Tip Rack 200 µL on Slot 10
6. Aspirate 200 uL from Column 12 (A12) of Master Mix Reservoir
7. Dispense 20 uL into Column 1 (A1) of Plate 1 on Slot 7

**Steps 7 will repeat for the entire plate.**

8. Drop tips into Opentrons Fixed Trash Bin

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
