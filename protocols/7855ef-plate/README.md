### Author
[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/)


# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* AgriSeq HTS Library Kit

## Description
This protocol is the first of a 4 part series for performing NGS library prep with the [ThermoFisher Scientific AgriSeq kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A34144#/A34144). The OT-2 will distribute 7ul of Amplification Mix to each well of 96 well plates up to the number of samples specified by the user. 3ul of DNA is then added to each well containing Ampflication Mix.

Links:
* [Part 1: DNA Transfer](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/7855ef-plate)
* [Part 2: Pre-Ligation](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/7855ef-plate-part2)
* [Part 3: Barcoding](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/7855ef-plate-part3)
* [Part 4: Pooling](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/7855ef-plate-part4)

**Note about tips**
The OT-2 will track tips from Part 1 to Part 4 of the protocol (e.g. tip leaves off in H11 at the end of protocol 1; first tip pick up will be from H12 in Part 2). When tips run out for any particular Part, the user will be prompted to replace all tip racks.

**Update (July 18, 2022):** The custom touch tip has been adjusted

**Note About Labware**
The ThermoFisher 96 well plate (model 4483352) is to be mounted on top of the BioRad Hard-shell plate, making one plate with a moniker of "Custom 96 Well Endura Plate".

**Note About Sample Number**
Part 4 of this protocol will pool 5ul from wells until a 60ul pool is achieved (i.e. a full plate would have one pool per row). If there is less than a full plate loaded, the protocol will iterate through wells dependent on the sample number specified until 60ul is reached. Please consider the following examples:

* 96 sample run (1 plate): 1 column of 60ul pools.
* 144 sample run (1.5 plates): 1 column and 4 wells of 60ul pools.
* 216 sample run (2.25 plates): 2 columns and 2 wells of 60ul pools.

**It is thus critical to load samples that can be discretely divided by 12.**

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* Number of Samples: Specify the number of samples to be processed in this run (max 288).
* P20 single GEN2 mount: Specify which mount to load the P20 single GEN2 pipette.


**Note about 20µL tip racks**

When prompted to replace the 20ul tip racks, be sure to re-load all 3 tip racks as in the original configuration of the deck.

**Labware Setup**

Slots 1, 2, 3: ThermoFisher Scientific (model AB0800) 96 well plate loaded with DNA sample.  

Slot 4, 5, 6: Custom 96 Well Endura Plate (empty)

Slot 7: MMX Plate with Amplification Mix in Column 1

Slot 8, 9, 10, 11: Opentrons 20ul Tip Rack
