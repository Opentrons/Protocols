## Description
This protocol preps a 384 well plate for up to 5 cDNA samples in triplicates. The protocol can be broken down into 2 main parts:

* cDNA is added in triplicates down the column onto the plate.
* Mastermix is added to the cDNA

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Mastermix in triplicates across columns (new) or whole columns (original)`: Specify whether to run the new protocol (box method) or original protocol (which may break a box method).
* `Number of cDNA`: Specify the number of cDNA tubes that will be loaded onto the tube rack.
* `Number of mastermix tubes`: Specify the number of mastermix tubes that will be added to the cDNA.
* `Dispense Flow Rate`: Specify the rate to dispense mastermix. A value of 1 is default, a value of 0.5 is half of the default value, and a value of 1.2 would be 20% higher than the default value, for example.
* `Blowout Flow Rate`: Specify the rate to blowout mastermix. A value of 1 is default, a value of 0.5 is half of the default value, and a value of 1.2 would be 20% higher than the default value, for example.
* `Reset Tipracks?`: The OT-2 will track tips from run to run of the protocol (e.g. tip leaves off in H11 at the end of protocol 1; first tip pick up will be from H12 in Part 2). When tips run out for any particular run, the user will be prompted to replace all tip racks. The user will also have the option to "Reset Tip Racks" in the customized parameters section. Reset tip racks to pick up from A1 of the first tip rack of any one protocol.
* `P20 Mount`: Specify the mount (left or right) for the P20 single channel pipette.

### Deck Setup
* Note: Mastermixes and cDNA tubes should be placed on their respective tube racks by column. Please look at the deck layout below for a full run (5 genes and 24 mastermixes).

### Protocol Steps
1. cDNA is transferred in triplicates down a column up to the number of columns as specified in number of mastermixes.
2. Mastermixes are added to each column up to each populated row.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
