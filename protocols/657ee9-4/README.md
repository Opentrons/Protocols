# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Oncomine Focus Assay

## Description
This is the fourth (and last) part in a multi-part protocol designed to automate the Oncomine Focus Assay. For a detailed description of the manual protocol, please see [this resource.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2022-01-27/kk23ns4/MAN0015819_Part1_OFAv1S5FTLibraryPrep_UG.pdf)

In this protocol, the OT-2 automates the 'Purify The Library' and the 'Elute The Library' portions of the protocol. Using the complex parameters described below, the user can specify which, if any, modules they are using and select from different options pertaining to RNA/cDNA and DNA (**Columns with Samples**).

**Update**: Protocol was updated to accommodate single column input.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* **Columns with Samples**: Specify which columns should we receive the FuPa reagent. Column numbers should be separated by a comma (,).
* **P300-Multi Mount**: Select which mount the [P300 Multi-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/8-channel-electronic-pipette/) is attached to.

### Protocol Steps
1. For each column of samples, the [P300 Multi-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/8-channel-electronic-pipette/) will pick up a set of tips, transfer 45µL of Agencout AMPure XP Reagent from Column 1 of the [NEST 12-Well Reservoir](https://shop.opentrons.com/nest-12-well-reservoirs-15-ml/) to the plate containing samples, mix 5 times, then discard the tips.
2. There will be a 5 minute incubation period ([Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) disengaged).
3. There will be a 2 minute incubation period ([Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) engaged).
