	* NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep


## Description
This protocol is part 5 of a 10 part series. Please look at deck map and liquid legend below. Note: the TE buffer can accommodate 3 columns of sample per column of wash. Each ethanol column can accommodate 4 columns of sample. If running more than one column of reagent, the volumes should be split equally among all columns.

### Protocol Steps
1. Samples added to mag plate
2. Beads added to samples
3. Incubate
4. Remove supernatant
5. Two ethanol washes
6. Air dry beads
7. Elute with TE
8. Incubate
9. Move cDNA to final plate


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
