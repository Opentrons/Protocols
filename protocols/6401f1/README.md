This protocol was developed to combine custom volumes of master mixes with custom volumes of sample, positive control, or no-template control for PCR/qPCR setup.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: PCR plate (96-deep-well BioRad Hard Shell Plate) in deck slot 1, Master Mix 24-Tube Rack in deck slot 2, Samples (LVL 96-Tube Rack) in deck slot 3, Positive and NTC (LVL 96-Tube Rack) in deck slot 6, p20 tips in deck slot 4, p300 tips in deck slot 5.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. step 1- Transfer master mix volumes to PCR plate wells according to input data in the csv file.
2. step 2- Transfer sample and positive, no-template control to PCR plate wells according to input data in the csv file.
