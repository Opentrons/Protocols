With this protocol, your robot can perform the Illumina DNA Prep with Enrichment protocol described by the [Illumina DNA Prep with Enrichment Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_kits/illumina-dna-prep-with-enrichment/documentation.html).

This is part 2 of the protocol, which includes the steps (1) Clean Up and Pool Libraries (2) Hybridize and Capture Probes (3) Amplify Enriched Library and (4) Clean Up Enriched Library.

The first clean up uses a double-sided bead purification for consistently narrow fragment size distribution. Up to 12 libraries with unique indexes are combined into one pool. Streptavidin magnetic beads are used to capture probes hybridized to target sequences. The enriched library is then amplified by PCR.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: Set the block temperature for the thermocycler module to 10 degrees Celsius by using settings in the OT app. Place reagents in the reservoir and aluminum block in deck slots 2 and 3 as shown [Protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-03-24/dw03wwr/Opentron%20protocol.docx).

The OT-2 will perform the steps as shown [Protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-03-24/dw03wwr/Opentron%20protocol.docx).

## Process
1. Input your number of samples (up to 12).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map below.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".
