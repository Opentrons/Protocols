# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Normalization


## Description
This protocol allows for a robust cherrypicking and normalization in one step.</br>
</br>
Using two CSV files (Dilutant CSV and Sample CSV), the OT-2 will make all transfers of dilutant using a single tip (transfers based on Dilutant CSV). Then, using a new tip for each transfer, the OT-2 will make each sample transfers according to the Sample CSV (the dilutant and sample will be mixed after dispensing the sample).</br>
</br>
The two .csv files should be formatted as shown in the example below, **including headers**:

```
Source Labware,Source Slot,Source Well,Source Aspiration Height Above Bottom (in mm),Dest Labware,Dest Slot,Dest Well,Dest Dispense Height Above Bottom (in mm),Volume (in ul),Pipette
agilent_1_reservoir_290ml,1,A1,1,nest_96_wellplate_100ul_pcr_full_skirt,4,A11,1,5,right
nest_12_reservoir_15ml,2,A1,1,nest_96_wellplate_2ml_deep,5,A5,5,3,right
nest_1_reservoir_195ml,3,A1,1,nest_96_wellplate_2ml_deep,5,H12,5,7,right
```

All available empty slots will be filled with the necessary tipracks, and the user will be prompted to refill the tipracks if all are emptied in the middle of the protocol.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Deck Setup
* example layout based on example `.csv` above:  
![deck](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/76c562/deckex.png)

## Process
1. Input your protocol parameters.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
