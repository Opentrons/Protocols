# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Featured
	* PCR Prep

## Description
This protocol automates certain steps of the [Lyra Direct SARS-CoV Assay](https://www.quidel.com/molecular-diagnostics/lyra-direct-sars-cov-2-assay). These steps include the addition of process buffer to the deep well block, mixing of the deep well block, and transferring samples to the PCR plate.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the total sample number (including controls, For Example: if you have 38 patient samples and 2 controls, you would enter 40), select Pipette Types (Both either, Single Channel or Multichannel), select Left Pipette Type, select Right Pipette Type, select Tip Type)
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
5. Hit "Run".
