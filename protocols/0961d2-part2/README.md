## Description
This protocol is part 2 of a 4-part protocol designed to accomplish the Sample-Barcoding Module of the [plexWell 384 Low Pass Library Preparation](https://seqwell.com/products/plexwell-lp-384/).


[Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part1)
[Part 2](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part2)
[Part 3](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part3)
[Part 4](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part4)


This protocol accomplishes Step 2 (SB Reaction Stop). During this protocol, 7.5µL of X Solution is added to each well of a 96-Well Plate (SBP96), containing samples from [Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0961d2-part1). With this protocol, you are given the option to use 1-4 plates for this step, for higher throughputs. The SBP96 plates should be loaded in the column containing slots 2, 5, 8, and 11 (sequentially). For each plate, a tip rack should be placed in the adjoining slot (slots 1, 4, 7, and 10).
