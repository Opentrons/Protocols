## Description
This protocol automates the first part of a ten part protocol for the [GeneRead QIAact Lung RNA Fusion UMI Panel Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/instruments-and-automation/genereader-system/generead-qiaact-lung-panels-ww/?catno=181936) which constructs molecularly bar-coded DNA libraries for digital sequencing. This protocol automates the First strand cDNA synthesis part described in the [GeneRead QIAact Lung RNA Fusion UMI Panel Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=1a71d98a-c45c-44fa-b4af-874cd1d2b61f&lang=en).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: The total number of DNA samples. Samples must range between 1 (minimum) and 12 (maximum).
* `Samples Labware Type`: The starting samples can be placed in either 1.5 mL tubes on the Opentrons Tube Rack OR in a 96 Well Plate.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.

### Protocol Steps
**Note:** The protocol assumes the samples have been diluted to 20 ng/uL.
1. Pre-heat Thermocycler to 65°C with a heated lid at 103°C.
2. Cool the temperature module to 4°C.
3. Place Aluminum block with PCR plate on top of the temperature module.
4. Transfer 5 uL of RNA to PCR plate on temperature module.
5. Add 1 uL of RP Primer to RNA samples on PCR plate.
6. Mix 7 times with a volume of 4 uL.
7. Centrifuge PCR plate with samples for 15 seconds.
8. Place PCR plate in the thermocycler.
9. Incubate at 65°C for 5 minutes.
10. Remove the PCR plate from the thermocycler and place on ice OR temperature module for a few minutes.
11. Briefly centrifuge before the next protocol.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
