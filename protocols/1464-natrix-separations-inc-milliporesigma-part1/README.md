* [Part 1: Dilution](./1464-natrix-separations-inc-milliporesigma-part1)
* [Part 2-1: Antibody Addition](./1464-natrix-separations-inc-milliporesigma-part2)
* [Part 2-2: Substrate and Stop Solution Addition](1464-natrix-separations-inc-milliporesigma-part3)

This is the first part of a ELISA protocol: Dilution Procedure. The robot will perform serial dilutions samples located in the Opentrons 2 mL Eppendorf tube rack in the 1.2 mL tube plates. User will need to upload a CSV specifying the desired concentrations of each sample to be transferred to a separate 96-well plate in part 2 of the protocol. See more information on the CSV requirement in Additional Notes below.

You will need:
* P1000 Single-channel Pipette
* P300 Single-channel Pipette
* [Opentrons Tube Racks (2 mL Eppendorf)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/tube-rack-set-1)
* [Opentrons Tube Rack (15 + 50 mL)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/tube-rack-set-1)
* [1.2 mL Tube Rack](https://www.usascientific.com/1.2ml-tube-individual-racked-sterile.aspx)
* 96-well Plate
* 12-row Trough
* 1000 uL Tip Rack
* 300 uL Tip Rack

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".


### Additional Notes
Tube Rack setup: (slot 4)
* DI Water: A1
* Diluent: A2
* HCP Standards: A3-B2 if number of standards is 6, A3-B4 if 8
* Samples: B3-(D6) if number of standards is 6, B5-(D6) if 8
You will need to shift the locations of the samples based on the number of standards you have each run. This configuration must be consistent of that of part 2.

CSV Layout:

![csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/1464-natrix-separations-inc-milliporesigma/csv_layout.png)

* No headers
* Each row represents each sample
* Each column represents the dilution factor of that sample to be transferred to the output plate in part 2 of the protocol
* Robot will determine the dilution scheme of each sample based on the concentrations in the CSV
