Centrifuge the PCR plate from the Amplify Tagmented DNA step. Place the plate on the magnetic module.

12-channel reservoir (slot 3)
* channel 1: SPB (user is prompted to vortex before adding mid-protocol)
* channel 2: nuclease-free water
* channel 3: RSB
* channel 4-5: EtOH
* channels 10-12: liquid waste (loaded empty)

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the type and mount sides for your P50 and P300 pipettes, the DNA type, and the number of samples to process.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
