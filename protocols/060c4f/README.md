## Description
This protocol automates the distribution of samples from a 96-well plate (on the Temperature Module) to a 384-well plate.</br>
</br>
Given the mapping differences between a 96-well plate and a 384-well plate, the user can specify to transfer to *odd* rows (A/C/E...) or *even* rows (B/D/F...).</br>
</br>
This protocol uses a custom labware definition for the [Greiner Bio-One 384-well plate](https://shop.gbo.com/en/row/products/bioscience/microplates/384-well-microplates/384-deep-well-small-volume-polypropylene-microplate/784201.html). When downloading the protocol, the labware definition (a JSON file) will be included for use with this protocol. For more information on using custom labware on the OT-2, please see this article: [Using labware in your protocols](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols)

## Process

1. Download your protocol package containing the custom labware definition for the 384-well plate.
2. Upload the labware definition in the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app). For help, please see [this article](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols).
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
