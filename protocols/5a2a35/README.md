## Description

This protocol uses a p300 single channel pipette to transfer custom volumes of DNA from a source plate to a destination plate (starting tip, volume, deck slots and well locations specified in a csv file which has been made available by the user on the OT-2 using the OT-2 jupyter notebook).

This protocol was developed to transfer custom volumes of DNA from one of possibly several source plates to one of possibly several destination plates according to volumes, deck slot numbers, and well locations in a csv file made available by the user on the OT-2 using the OT-2 jupyter notebook.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: Up to a total of 6 source and destination plates (number should be equal to plate_count parameter value set below at the time of protocol download) should be placed in deck slots 1-6 (adhering to deck slot fill order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), three boxes of Opentrons 200 ul filter tips in deck slots 7-9, deck slots 10 and 11 empty.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. CSV indicates starting tip location.
2. Tip picks up.
3. Aspirate DNA volume based on CSV.
4. Aspirate air gap of 5uL.
5. Transfer DNA to destination location/well based on CSV.
6. Dispense full amount toward the bottom of the well.
7. Discard tip in trash.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until all lines in CSV are completed.

## Process
1. Use the protocol parameter settings on this page to choose the number of plates on deck.
2. Download your protocol.
3. This step applies only to this particular protocol. Be sure that an input csv file with file name datafile.csv (containing info about starting tip, source and destination plate deck slots, well locations and transfer volumes-see example for data and file format) has been made available on the OT-2 filesystem in the expected directory location using the OT-2 jupyter notebook.
4. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
