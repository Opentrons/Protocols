In this protocol, the [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) transfers 220µL of supernatant from source plate containing cells to a destination plate. Once complete, the [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will transfer 100µL of PBS to the original source plate.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* **P300-Multi Mount**: Select which mount the P300-Multi Pipette is attached to.
* **Aspirate from Well Bottom Height**: Specify the height from the bottom of the well (in mm) that the pipette will aspirate supernatant (note: default height is 1mm from bottom).
* **Perform 2nd aliquot**: Specify whether or not to perform a second aliquot (110µL transferred to plate in slot 5)

### Protocol Steps
1. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will pick up tips.
2. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will transfer 220µL of supernatant from Column 1 of the Source Plate to Column 1 of the Destination Plate.
3. If performing the second aliquot, the [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will transfer 100µL of supernatant from Column 1 of the Source Plate to Column 1 of the Second Destination Plate.
4. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will drop used tips in the waste bin.
5. Steps 1-4 will be repeated for columns 2-10.
6. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will pick up tips.
7. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will mix PBS, then transfer 100µL of PBS to Column 1 of the Source Plate (dispensing at the top of the well).
8. Step 7 will be repeated for columns 2-10 of the Source Plate.
9. [P300 8-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/8-Channel-electronic-pipette) will drop used tips in the waste bin.
10. End of the protocol.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol bundle.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions), if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
