# Mag-Bind Environmental DNA 96 Kit Steps

## Initial Optional Steps on OT-2 Temperature Module:

1. Set Temp Deck to 70C
2. Heat Elution Buffer to 70C

## Outside OT-2 Initial Steps:

1. Pause Function - Centrifuge E-Z 96 Disruptor Plate C Plus (E-Z 96 Plate) to remove ceramic beads
2. Add Samples to E-Z 96 Plate

## Begin Main Protocol (OT-2):

1. Add 525 uL SLX-Mlus Buffer and 2 µL RNase A buffer to E-Z 96 Plate.
2. Pause - Seal plate with the caps. Vortex for 3-5 minutes.
3. Pause - Centrifuge at 500g for 10 seconds
4. Pause - Remove and Discard Caps from E-Z 96 Plate
5. Add 53 uL DS Buffer
6. Pause - Seal plate with new caps for racked microtubes. Then vortex to mix thoroughly.
7. Incubate EZ 96 Plate on Temp Mod at 70C for 10 minutes (Gram+ 2nd incubation at 95C?)
8. Pause - Centrifuge at >2000g for 10 minutes at room temp.
9. Transfer 200 uL supernatant from E-Z 96 Plate to a new 96-well Racked Microtubes
10. Pause - Transfer Prechilled P2 Buffer into reservoir
11. Add 67 uL of P2 buffer to new 96-well Racked Microtubes(?)
12. Add 100 uL of cHTR reagent to new 96-well Racked Microtubes(?)
13. Pause - Centrifuge >2000g for 5 minutes
14. Transfer supernatant to NEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom (on top of mag mod)
15. Add 1 volume XP1 Buffer and 20 µL Mag-Bind® Particles RQ. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 10 times.
16. Pause - Incubate at Room Temp for 10 minutes (Mixing?)
17. Engage Mag Mod and Delay for 5 minutes to allow mag beads to settle on the walls
18. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads. (Might require putting pipette to the side)
19. Disengage Mag Mod
20. Add 500 uL of VHB Buffer to NEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom
21. Pause - Vortex 30-60 seconds at RT
22. Engage Mag Mod and Delay for X minutes
23. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads. (Might require putting pipette to the side)
24. Disengage Mag Mod
25. Add 500 uL of 70% Ethanol to NEST 2 mL 96-Well Deep Well Plate, V Bottom
26. Pause - Vortex for 30-60 seconds at RT
27. Engage Mag Mod and Delay for X minutes
28. Aspirate supernatant and discard without touching the magnetic beads. (Might require putting pipette to the side)
29. Repeat 24-28 for a second ethanol wash
30. While the mag mod is engaged, delay 1 minute and then remove any liquid (Aspirate for the opposite side of the pellet).
31. While mag mod is engaged, delay for 10 minutes to allow mag beads to dry
32. Add 50-100 uL of elution buffer preheated to 70C? (Find a way to preheat this easily)
33. Pause - Vortex for 5 minutes
34. Engage Mag Mod and Delay for X minutes to allow mag beads to settle on the walls (Let sit at room temperature until the Mag-Bind® Particles RQ are completely cleared from solution.)
35. Transfer clear supernatant containing purified DNA to NEST 0.1 mL 96 Well PCR Plate, Full Skirt

## Reagents
Elution Buffer
SLX-Mlus Buffer + RNase A buffer (Master Mix)
DS Buffer
P2 Buffer (Prechill on ice)
cHTR
Mag-Bind® Particles RQ + XP1 Buffer (Master Mix)
VHB Buffer
70% Ethanol

## Questions for User

1. Will you create a master mix with the SLX-Mlus Buffer and RNase A buffer? The kit suggests SLX-Mlus Buffer and RNase A can be made as a mastermix. (Step 3)
2. Are you going to be isolating DNA from gram positive bacteria? If so do you want the option for a second incubation at 95C? (Step 8 in the protocol)
3. Will you create a master mix with Mag-Bind® Particles RQ and XP1 Buffer? (Step 14)
4. Step 15 suggests continuous mixing will increase yield. Do you want it to just sit in room temp or do you also want regular mixing during those 10 minutes?
5. In step 21 how long do you want to engage the magnetic in the magnetic module?
6. How much supernatant do you want to discard in the follow steps (17, 22, 27, )
7. Do you want to use a separate waste container for liquids or is the regular trash fine?
8. Do you have a preference on how you wish to heat the elution buffer to 70C? Do you want to put it in a separate reservoir of its own and heat it using the temperature module?

## Protocol Clarifications
1. In step 11, is the P2 Buffer and cHTR reagent being added to the new 96 well racked microtubes or the EZ 96 Plate?
2. In step 13, how much supernatant needs to be transferred?
3.
