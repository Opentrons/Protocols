## Description
This protocol performs aliquoting of multiple buffers from different reservoirs into multiple 2 mL KingFisher deep well plates.

## Protocol Steps

1. Aliquot 500uL from a 15mL -12 section reservoir (wash 1 solution) into a 96, 2mL deep well plate.
2. Aliquot 1000uL from a 15mL-12 section reservoir (wash 2 (80% ETOH) into a second 96, 2 mL deep well plate.
3. Aliquot 50uL from a 15mL-12 section reservoir (elution buffer) into a 96, 2mL deep well plate.
