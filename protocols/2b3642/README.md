## Description
This protocol automates various parts of the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina E7645S using the OT-2 and additional hardware modules. The protocol is divided into five sections which includes the following: End Preparation, Adaptor Ligation, Cleanup of Adaptor-Ligated DNA, PCR Amplication and Cleanup of PCR Reaction.

The protocol will also pause at various stages prompting for user intervention to replace reagents, tip racks, and perform centrifugation of reaction mixtures.

* `Number of Samples`: The total number of samples or reactions being run. This kit supports a maximum of 24 samples. Please enter sample numbers in multiples of 8 (Ex: 8, 16, 24).
* `P300 Multichannel GEN2 Mount Position`: The position your P300 Multichannel GEN2 pipette is mounted (Left or Right).
* `P20 Single Channel GEN2 Mount Position`: The position your P300 Multichannel GEN2 pipette is mounted (Left or Right).
* `Initial Denaturation Cycles`: Number of cycles at 98C for 30 seconds.
* `Denaturation and Annealing/Extension Cycles`: Number of cycles at 98C for 10 seconds and 65C for 75 seconds.
