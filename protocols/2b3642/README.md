## Description
This protocol automates various parts of the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina E7645S using the OT-2 and additional hardware modules. The protocol is divided into five sections which includes the following: End Preparation, Adaptor Ligation, Cleanup of Adaptor-Ligated DNA, PCR Amplication and Cleanup of PCR Reaction.
