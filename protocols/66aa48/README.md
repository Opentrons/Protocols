# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Cherrypicking


## Description
This protocol allows the robot to create up to 4 different pooling samples by consolidating cherrypicked wells from a 96 tall-well plates. The user will need upload one CSV each for increase, no change, decrease, and inactive property changes. Each CSV will contain information of the wells from which to be picked. See Additional Notes for the format of the CSVs, as well as the arrangement of pooling tubes in the Opentrons 4x6 2ml Eppendorf tuberack. If you would like to skip a pool as specified by 1 of the 4 CSV files, upload an empty CSV file corresponding to that pool.

Your CSV files should contain source wells of the 96-well source plate each on its own line, as in the following:  
```
A2
A3
A4
A7
A8
B3
B5
```

The pooling tubes are seated in the Opentrons tube rack according to the following setup:
* inactive: tube A1
* decrease: tube B1
* no change: tube C1
* increase: tube D1
