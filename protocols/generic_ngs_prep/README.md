## Description
This protocol performs a generic NGS Library Prep. It utilizes up to three temperature modules in Slot 1, 4 and 7 for the cooling of reagents. It also utilizes the magnetic module for bead based purification of samples.

Explanation of parameters below:
* `P20 Multichannel GEN2 Mount Position`: Choose the mount position of the P20 Multichannel GEN2 pipette. (left or right)
* `P300 Multichannel GEN2 Mount Position`: Choose the mount position of the P300 Multichannel GEN2 pipette. (left or right
* `Number of Samples`: Enter total number of samples in the protocol run. **Note: Because both pipettes are 8-channels, the number of samples should be a multiple of 8 or close if possible, otherwise it will use up additional tips for an entire column.**
* `Temperature module in slot 1` (Optional parameter) Specify which temperature module to use in slot 1 (or None). This temperature module would allow the user to control the temperature of the sample plate in part 1 of the protocol.
*  `Temperature module in slot 1` (Optional parameter) Specify which temperature module to use in slot 4 (or None). This temperature module would allow the user to control the temperature of reagent plate 1 in part 1 of the protocol, and the primer plate in part 2.
*  `Temperature module in slot 7` (Optional parameter) Specify which temperature module to use in slot 7 (or None). This temperature module would allow the user to control the temperature of reagent plate 2 in part 1 of the protocol, and the Indexing plate in part 2.
* `Sample plate` The sample plate holds DNA samples and is the site of mixing with buffers and reagents in part 1.
* `Reagent 1 plate` The reagent 1 plate holds the first mixing reagent in column 1 (e.g. a buffer or an enzyme) to be mixed with the samples
* `Reagent 2 plate` The reagent 2 plate holds the second mixing reagent in column 1 (e.g. a buffer or an enzyme) to be mixed with the samples.
* `Primer plate` Contains primers to be mixed with DNA samples in step 2
* `Reagent reservoir` The (12 well) reservoir contains paramagnetic bead solution, PCR buffer, and PCR mastermix.
* `Ethanol reservoir` Ethanol solution for washing beads, e.g. 80:20 ethanol:water. Uses 180 µL per sample
* `Number of Samples` The number of DNA samples (up to 96)
* `Temperature (deg C) for temperature module on slot x in part 1` These parameters for each of the temperature modules allow the user to set the temperatures for all/any temperature module in part 1.
* `Temperature (deg C) for temperature module on slot x in part 2` These parameters for each of the temperature modules allow the user to set the temperatures for all/any temperature module in part 2.
* `Volume of reagent 1 to add` Volume of reagent 1 to add to samples, e.g. an enzyme or a reaction buffer
* `Volume of reagent 2 to add` Volume of reagent 2 to add to samples, e.g. an enzyme or a reaction buffer
* `Ethanol wash volume` The volume of ethanol solution to use for bead washing
* `Mastermix volume` Volume of PCR mastermix for the PCR reaction in step 2, this is added to the indexing plate
* `Primer mix volume` Volume of primer mix for the PCR reaction in step 2, this is added to the indexing plate
* `Bead volume` Volume of paramagnetic bead solution to use for cleaning up the DNA from the enzymatic reaction in part 1 of the protocol
* `Elution buffer volume` The volume of elution buffer to use for eluting the DNA after the ethanol cleanup
* `Sample volume` The initial volume of DNA on the sample plate
* `DNA supernatant volume` The volume of clean DNA to be transferred from the magnetic deck plate to the indexing plate to be used in the PCR reaction
