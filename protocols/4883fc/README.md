# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
![Normalization Example](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/normalization/normalization_example.png)

Concentration normalization is a key component of many genomic and proteomic applications, such as NGS library prep. With this protocol, you can easily normalize the concentrations of samples in a 96-well plate from either 1.5ml snapcap tubes, or another 96-well plate. The transfers should be specified as an input .csv file formatted as shown here:

```
Sample number,Slot no number,Source well,Destination well,Start Concentration (ug/uL) Source,Final Concentraion (ug/ml) Destination,Sample volume (uL),Diluent Volume(ul),Total Volume(ul) Destination
1,4,A1,A1,5,2,40,60,100.0
2,4,C1,B1,3,2,67,33,100.0
3,4,D1,C1,10,2,20,80,100.0
4,4,E3,D1,20,2,10,90,100.0
```

You can also download and edit [this template](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/4883fc/example.xlsx). Be sure to export the `.xlsx` format to `.csv` format before inputting as the `input .csv file` below!

### Deck Setup

* if sources are arranged in a 96-well plate:  
![plate](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/4883fc/plate.png)

### Reagent Setup
* NEST 12-channel reservoir (slot 9): diluent (10000µl per channel, dependent on number of normalizations)

### Protocol Steps
1. Diluent is transferred in the proper amounts to each destination well of the end PCR plate using 1 tip for the entire set of transfers.
2. The first sample is transferred to its specified destination well with pre-added diluent, the well is mixed 3x. After dispense, a blowout and touch tip are performed. The tip is then dropped.
3. Step 2 is repeated for as many samples as specified in the .csv file.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
