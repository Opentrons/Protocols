## Description

This protocol transfers spheroids from a standard U-bottom 384-well plate to a specialized Akura 384-well plate. Samples are transferred to their corresponding wells. Tips are automatically changed after 16 columns to reflect new cell type. Flow rates and well positions are optimized to accurately transfer spheroid avoiding shearing.
