## Description
This protocol performs viral titration (serial dilution) of viral samples. It adds media to the dilution plates and then begins the serial dilution process of up to 12 columns worth of samples. It will dilute the samples in one of four dilution plates and then add it to the analysis dish in a specific order (skipping 3 columns for every dilution).

### Protocol Steps
1. Transfer appropriate volumes of media from the reservoir to each dilution plate on a per column basis using the multichannel pipette.
2. Sample from the first column (A1) is transferred to A1 of Dilution Plate 1 where it is mixed and then transffered to A1 on analysis dish 1.
3. Diluted sample is transferred from A1 of Dilution Plate 1 to A1 of Dilution Plate 2. It is thoroughly mixed and then transferred to A4 on Analysis Dish 1.
4. Diluted sample is transferred from A1 of Dilution Plate 2 to A1 of Dilution Plate 3. It is thoroughly mixed and then transferred to A7 on Analysis Dish 1.
5. Diluted sample is transferred from A1 of Dilution Plate 3 to A1 of Dilution Plate 4. It is thoroughly mixed and then transferred to A10 on Analysis Dish 1.
6. This completes one set of samples. This cycle will repeat for up to 12 columns worth of samples across four analysis dishes.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
