## Description
This protocol is based on Makimura and Suzuki's, 'Quantitative determination of bovine serum haptoglobin and its elevation in some inflammatory diseases' (1982) paper. The protocol begins by doing a serial dilution, then makes the necessary transfers for the haptoglobin protocol. The robot will pause before an incubation step so that the user can intervene and resume when ready.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
This protocol requires user intervention. Whenever user intervention is required (primarily for off-robot mixing/vortexing), the robot will stop and a prompt with more instructions will appear in the OT app.

If you have any questions about this protocol, please contact the Protocol Development Team by filling out the [Troubleshooting Survey](https://protocol-troubleshooting.paperform.co/).
