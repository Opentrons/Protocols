## Description
This protocol transfers sample from [NEST 96-Well Plates](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-0-1-ml-96-well-pcr-plate-full-skirt) to [Applied Biosystems MicroAmp 384-well plates](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4343370#/4343370) with mastermix. **Update**: this protocol has been updated to accommodate the SSI 384-well plate as well.</br>
</br>
The protocol can fill one or two, 384-well plates. The [P20 Single-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes) will aspirate 5µL from each well of the [NEST 96-Well Plates](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-0-1-ml-96-well-pcr-plate-full-skirt) and dispense 2.5µL into two wells of the (A1 --> A1/B1; B1 --> C1/D1; etc.)</br>
</br>
**Update (10/22/20):** The protocol will now aspirate 10µL and dispense 5µL into two wells.</br>
</br>
**Update (11/2/20):** The protocol will now aspirate 20µL and dispense 10µL into two wells. Additionally, the option to use the p300-multi pipette has been added.
**Updated (11/12/20):** A new parameter has been added that allows the user to input the volume (in µL) of sample that should be transferred. The pipette will aspirate 2x the volume and dispense into two wells.
