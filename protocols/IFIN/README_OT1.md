## Description
This protocol allows the robot to transfer aqueous solutions from a reservoir (plate A, 96-well plate) to an experimental plate (plate B, 96-well plate).

Steps:
1. Transfers 35 uL from plate A row 10 to plate B rows 1-4, plate A row 11 to plate B rows 5-8, and plate A row 12 to plate B rows 9-12, using the same pipette tips.
2. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 7 to plate B rows 7-12, plate A row 9 to plate B rows 1-6, using the same pipette tips.
3. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 8 to all of plate 8, using the same pipette tips.
4. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 1 to plate B rows 1 and 7, using new tips for each transfer.
5. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 2 to plate B rows 2 and 8, using new tips for each transfer.
6. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 3 to plate B rows 3 and 9, using new tips for each transfer.
7. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 4 to plate B rows 4 and 10, using new tips for each transfer.
8. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 5 to plate B rows 5 and 11, using new tips for each transfer.  
9. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 6 to plate B rows 6 and 12, using new tips for each transfer.
