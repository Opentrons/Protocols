## Description
This protocol is written for enzyme activity assays, which usually measure the consumption of substrates or production of products. This protocol can be used by similar assays that require the robot to transfer several aqueous solutions from a reservoir (plate A, 96-well plate) to an experimental plate (plate B, 96-well plate).

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol onto the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your tiprack, pipette, plate, and petri dishes using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support articles:

5. Hit "Run Job".
6. Transfers 35 uL from plate A row 10 to plate B rows 1-4, plate A row 11 to plate B rows 5-8, and plate A row 12 to plate B rows 9-12, using the same pipette tips.
7. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 7 to plate B rows 7-12, plate A row 9 to plate B rows 1-6, using the same pipette tips.
8. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 8 to all of plate 8, using the same pipette tips.
9. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 1 to plate B rows 1 and 7, using new tips for each transfer.
10. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 2 to plate B rows 2 and 8, using new tips for each transfer.
11. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 3 to plate B rows 3 and 9, using new tips for each transfer.
12. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 4 to plate B rows 4 and 10, using new tips for each transfer.
13. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 5 to plate B rows 5 and 11, using new tips for each transfer.  
14. Transfers 20 uL from plate A row 6 to plate B rows 6 and 12, using new tips for each transfer.
