Part 1: Tagmentation
Master mix is prepared offdeck and added to DNA samples. DNA samples are 30 uL in total volume. After master mix addition, the sample plate is put in a thermocycler pre-programmed as outlined in the reference manual.

Once the thermocycler is complete, part 2 can be run.

Variables:
* `Number of Samples`: Total number of samples from 1 to 48

### Protocol Steps
1. 20ul of Master Mix is transfered from PCR tubes in slot 1's temperature module to slot 2's samples. Tips will be changed each time

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
