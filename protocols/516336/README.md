Steps:

1. Take reagents from reservoir and put into PCR plate (plate should have samples?)
2. Mix plate and pause for spin down?
3. Incubate on TC 20C for 5 mins and 65C for 5 mins
4. Resuspend AMPure beads by pipette mixing
5. Transfer samples from BioRad Plate on TC to MIDI Plate on Mag Mod
6. Add 60 uL of AMPure XP to the samples on MIDI Plate on Mag Mod
7. Mix samples (mag plate) with pipette
8. Pause step for Hula mixer?
9. Pause step for spin down?
10. Engage magnet and delay for 5 minutes for beads to pellet
11. After 5 minutes, while engaged, remove supernatant
12. While engaged, wash beads with 200 uL of ethanol
13. Remove ethanol/supernatant. Discard tip.
14. Repeat 12-13
15. Pause for spin down.
16. While engaged, remove any residual ethanol. Delay for 30 seconds for drying.
17. Disengage mag mod and add 61 uL of nuclease-free water. Delay for 2 mins at room temp.
18. Engage magnet until eluate is clear (5 mins?)
19. Transfer 61 uL of eluate into MIDI plate part 2
