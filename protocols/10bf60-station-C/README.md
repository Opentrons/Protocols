# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep

## Description
This is a flexible protocol accommodating a wide range of PCR setups. Mastermix is transferred from a 2ml snapcap tube to clean PCR plate using a P20 GEN2 single-channel pipette. Then, a P20 GEN2 multi-channel pipette transfers eluates from RNA extraction to the PCR plate containing mastermix. Samples are transferred to their corresponding positions from plate to plate (A1 to A1, B1, to B1, etc.)

### Protocol Steps
1. P20 single-channel GEN2 pipette transfers reaction mix to each well of clean PCR plate using the same tip.
2. P20 multi-channel GEN2 pipette transfers eluates from extraction plate to PCR plate now containing reaction mix. Samples are mixed 3x at 10µl after each transfer. Tips are changed for each sample.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
