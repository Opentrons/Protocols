## Description

This is a flexible normalization protocol a 2-fold dilution to an input desired concentration followed by sample aliquoting in triplicate. Normalization parameters should be input as a .csv file below, and should be formatted as shown in the following template **including headers line**:

```
sample number,sample name,sample concentration (<0.25 mg/ml)
1,007007009-403-1,1.569
2,007007009-403-2,0.984
3,007007009-403-3,2.128

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
