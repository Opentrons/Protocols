# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
     * Zymoresearch: EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit

## Description
Part 3 of 5: Bisulfite converted DNA (output from step 2) is set up for a PCR amplification step. For plasma samples (but not saliva) the protocol includes post-PCR clean up steps.

* [Part 2: Bisulfite Conversion](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/76ba23-bisulfite_conversion)
* [Part 3: PCR1](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/76ba23-pcr1)

* [Part 5: Pooling](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/76ba23-pooling)

With this work flow, your robot will use reagents from the Zymoresearch EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit [Zymoresearch EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/ez-dna-methylation-gold-kits) to perform the custom steps (DNA extraction, Bisulfite Conversion, PCR1, PCR2, Pooling) detailed in the HKG SOP.[HKG SOP](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-03-04/vw23kchHKG%20Standard%20Operating%20Procedure%20for%20DNA%20extraction%20Targeted%20next%20generation%20sequencing%20and%20.xlsx).

This is part 3 of the work flow: Bisulfite Conversion.

This step performs set up for PCR amplification (with additional post-PCR clean up steps for plasma samples only) using the output samples from step 2 (Bisulfite Conversion).

After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 3), proceed with part 4: PCR2.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: Place bisulfite-converted DNA samples (output from Bisulfite Conversion in step 2), pcr1 master mix, beads, water, magnetic module and tips on the OT-2 deck.  

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Distribute sample and pcr1 master mix to the PCR plate.
2. Pause for the following steps (OT-2 deck lights will signal pauses):

           Thermocycling steps (outside of the OT-2).

           Replenish tips.

3. (Plasma only) Bead clean up, elute and transfer eluate to fresh PCR plate.

## Process
1. Set the "Choose Filtered or Standard Tips for P300 multi" and "Uploaded CSV Copy of Sample Manifest" parameters below.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
