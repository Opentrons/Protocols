# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling


## Description
This protocol allows the user to fill custom adapters according to their specifications (found below):

The user can choose between: Salmonella or Listeria Fill (90µL, 70µL respectively), how many plates to fill (1-9), single channel or multi-channel pipette (P300), and which column to pick up a tip from (row A, to avoid cross contamination).
