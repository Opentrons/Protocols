# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
This protocol automates preparation of plates that will be used in the Magnetic Particle Processing protocol on the KingFisher Flex.

This protocol is still a work in progress and will be updated.


Explanation of complex parameters below:
* **Number of Samples**: Specify the number of samples to be run (1-96).
* **Pipette Mount**: Select which mount the [P300 Single-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette) is attached to.

### Protocol Steps
1. The pipette ([P300 Single-Channel Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette)) will pick up a new tip, transfer 500µL (175/175/150) of Wash Buffer 1 to user-specified number of wells in the [KingFisher 96-Deepwell Plate](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305#/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305) in slot 4, then drop tip in the trash.
2. The pipette  will pick up a new tip, transfer 1000µL (200 x5) of Wash Buffer 2 to user-specified number of wells in the [KingFisher 96-Deepwell Plate](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305#/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305) in slot 1, then drop tip in the trash.
3. The pipette  will pick up a new tip, aspirate 200µL of Elution Buffer and dispense 50µL to user-specified number of wells (aspirating 200µL more whenever needed) in the [KingFisher 96-Deepwell Plate](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305#/A48305?SID=srch-hj-a48305) in slot 2, return any remaining Elution Buffer in the tip to the source, and finally drop the tip in the trash.
4. The pipette  will pick up a new tip, aspirate 140µL of Proteinase K and dispense 5µL to user-specified number of wells (in groups of 24) in the [KingFisher 96-Well Microplate](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/97002540?SID=srch-srp-97002540#/97002540?SID=srch-srp-97002540) in slot 3, then drop tip in the trash.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions), if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
