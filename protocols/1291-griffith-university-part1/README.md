With this protocol, your robot will generate up to 8 output plates by distributing cells and media following the format described in Additional Notes. A P300 single-channel and P300 multi-channel pipette are required for this protocol. You will also need [Biotix automation reservoirs](http://biotix.com/products/reservoirs/100-ml-automation-reservoir-sterilized/) and [Greiner Bio-One 384-well Plate](https://www.usascientific.com/384-well-cellstar-black-clearbottom-tc-plate.aspx).

### Modules

### Reagents

## Process
1. Input your desired medium volume.
2. Input your desired cell volume.
3. Input the number of plates you will be generating.
4. Download your protocol.
5. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
6. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
7. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
