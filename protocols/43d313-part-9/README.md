## Description

With this 9 part workflow, the OT-2 will follow [ArcBio Continuous RNA Workflow - Pre-PCR Instrument and Post-PCR Instrument experimental protocol](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/43d313/ArcBio_RNA_Workflow_020922.xlsx) to convert up to 96 input RNA samples into cDNA libraries. This is Part 9 of 9: This OT-2 protocol uses the RNA Continuous Workflow, Post-PCR Instrument section of attached experimental protocol to perform pooling steps.

## Protocol Steps

This is part 9 of 9 parts: Pooling.

Set up: Use settings in the Opentrons app prior to running this protocol to pre-cool the Temperature Module (deck slot 3) to 4 degrees C. Place Twin Tec 200 uL PCR plate with libraries on the Temperature Module. Place the Opentrons 24-tube rack with four 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes (in A1-A4 for pools 1-4) in deck slot 2. Place Opentrons 20 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_20ul in deck slot 10.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps using the p20 single-channel pipette and temperature module:
1. Use the p20 single to transfer the specified volume (specified in the uploaded csv file) of each library to one of the four pool tubes (3 source columns = 24 libraries per pool).
