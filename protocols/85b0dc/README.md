## Description

This protocol performs a custom Syber Green PCR Prep for up to 96 samples. Mastermix is transferred from 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes, and samples are transferred from source strip tubes mounted in the Opentrons 96-well aluminum block into the MicroAmp PCR plate also mounted in the Opentrons 96-well aluminum block.

The input .csv file should be formatted in the following way, including the header line:

```
source well (A1-H12),mastermix tube (A1-D6),destination well (A1-H12)
A1,A1,A1
A2,A2,A2
...
```
