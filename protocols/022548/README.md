# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* DNA Extraction

## Description
This protocol create a mastermix of binding buffer and bead mix. For large volumes the deck should use a NEST 12 well reservoir for the bead mix, for smaller number of samples a tuberack may be used as source for bead mix.

Designate the wells used for binding buffer and bead mix and the mastermix is created starting in the well immediately after, and uses as many wells as required for creating mastermix for the indicated number of samples. The protocol creates a dead volume in addition to the 'active' volume of mastermix (1 mL for reservoirs) - this is to avoid the pipette aspirating air during mastermix dispension in part 2 of the protocol.

The protocol will create a maximum volume of 9.54 mL per well, of which 1/3rd is dead volume.

The protocol is written to account for the changing liquid level of bead source tubes so that the pipette will not plunge too far into tube solutions.

Explanation of parameters below:
* `Create mastermix for how many numbers of samples`: How many samples to create mastermix for.
* `Binding buffer wells`: Designates which wells contain binding buffer, you may specify a range such as 1-4, or a single number if it is a single well. These number corresponds to the wells of the reservoir starting at the leftmost well.
* `Bead mix well(s)`: Which well(s) contain bead  mix. Just like the previous parameter it can be a number or a range, e.g. 5, or 5-6
* `Volume of binding buffer per source well (mL)`: How many milliliters of binding buffer is contained in each source reservoir well.
* `Volume of bead mix per source well (mL)`: How many milliliters of bead mix is contained in the source tube/reservoir well(s)
* `P300 single channel pipette mount`: Left or right mount
* `P300 multi channel pipette mount`: Left or right mount
* `Mastermix tuberack (Optional, only for small volumes of mastermix)`: Specify what kind of tuberack contains your bead mix tube. If this parameter is set to none the bead source will be a NEST 12 well reservoir instead (default).
* `Mastermix mixing rate multiplier`: The multiplier scales the flow rate of mixing aspirations and dispenses, e.g. 1.0 is the standard mixing rate, 0.5 would be half etc.
* `Binding buffer aspiration flow rate multiplier`: Controls the flow rate of aspiration when aspirating binding buffer from a source well
* `Binding buffer dispensing flow rate multiplier`: Controls the flow rate of dispension when dispensing binding buffer in a mastermix target well
* `Bead solution aspiration flow rate multiplier`: Controls the flow rate of aspiration when aspirating from a bread mix source well
* `Bead solution dispensing flow rate multiplier`: Controls the flow rate of dispension when dispensing bead mix in a mastermix target well
* `How many times do you want to mix the mastermix?`: Indicates the number of times you want to mix the mastermix solution after the binding buffer and bead mix have been added.
* `Mastermix mixing rate multiplier`: flow-rate modifier affecting the rate of aspiration and dispensing for mixing the mastermix after the addition of both components.
* `Offsets from the edges of the reservoir wells for bead mix dispenses (mm)`: Offset defining how close the pipette may get to the edge of the reservoir well when dispensing bead mix into the mastermix wells (which is dispensed in three different locations inside of the well)
* `Verbose protocol output?`: Indicates to the protocol whether it should output extra information about what it is doing.

### Reagent Setup
* This is an example of what a reagent/target reservoir setup may look like. In this example the binding buffer is in the first four wells, the bead mix is in the fifth well and then the next four wells are used to transfer reagents and mix mastermix.

* Reservoir: slot 10

### Protocol Steps
1. The binding buffer is distributed from the source wells to the target wells.
2. The bead mix is mixed ten times.
3. The bead mix is distributed from its source wells to its target wells.
4. The mastermix is mixed a number of times according to the parameter.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
