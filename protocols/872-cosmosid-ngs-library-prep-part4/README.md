## Description
Part 4 of 4: Pool Libraries

Links:
* [Part 1: Tagment and Amplify](./872-cosmosid-ngs-library-prep-part1) 
* [Part 2: Clean Up Libraries](./872-cosmosid-ngs-library-prep-part2) 
* [Part 3: Normalize Libraries](./872-cosmosid-ngs-library-prep-part3) 
* [Part 4: Pool Libraries](./872-cosmosid-ngs-library-prep-part4)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit protocol describe by the [Illumina Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_nextera/nextera-xt/nextera-xt-library-prep-reference-guide-15031942-03.pdf).

This is part 4 of the protocol, which is step (5) of the overall workflow: pool libraries. This step combines equal volumes of normalized libraries into a single tube so they can all be loaded onto the sequencer at once. After pooling, follow the instructions for your sequencer to dilute and heat-denature the library pool before loading libraries for the sequencing run.

Store unused pooled libraries in the PAL tube or SGP plate at -25°C to -15°C for up to 7 days.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Reagents
* [Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/nextera-xt-dna.html)

## Process
1. Input your number of samples (make sure it is consistent with part 1, 2, and 3).
2. Input the number of pooled libraries you would like to generate.
3. Input the volume of each library to be transferred to the tube.
4. Download your protocol.
5. Load your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
6. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
7. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
8. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
* Review the reference guide before proceeding to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables.
