## Categories
* Covid Workstation
	* RNA Extraction


## Description
This protocol automates the [Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Extraction Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-viral-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-viral-magbead). This kit is designed for high-throughput purification of viral DNA and/or RNA and the isolated nucleic acids are ready for all downstream applications, such as RT-qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, and many others.<br/>
<br/>
This kit can be used for Station B (RNA extraction) as part of our [COVID Workstation]().
