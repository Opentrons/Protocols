# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Covid Workstation
	* RNA Extraction


## Description
This protocol automates the [Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Extraction Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-viral-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-viral-magbead). This kit is designed for high-throughput purification of viral DNA and/or RNA and the isolated nucleic acids are ready for all downstream applications, such as RT-qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, and many others.<br/>
<br/>
This kit can be used for Station B (RNA extraction) as part of our [COVID Workstation](https://blog.opentrons.com/how-to-use-opentrons-to-test-for-covid-19/).
