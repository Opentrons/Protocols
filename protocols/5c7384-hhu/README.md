# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Mass Spec


## Description
This protocol performs mass spec sample prep per this [SP3 Proteomics manual (Appendix Protocol B)](https://www.embopress.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.15252%2Fmsb.20199111&file=msb199111-sup-0001-Appendix.pdf). The following steps are performed throughout the protocol with the use of the Opentrons OT-2, Thermocycler Module, and Magnetic Module (GEN2):

* Reduction and Alkylation
* Protein Binding
* Ethanol Wash
* Acetonitrile Wash
* On-Bead Digestion

Due to limited deck space, the user is prompted to change tipracks on the deck when needed, and to move labware when needed.
