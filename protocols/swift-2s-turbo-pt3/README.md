## Description
Part 3 of 3: Indexing PCR & Final Clean-Up

With this protocol, your [OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2) can perform the [Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit](https://swiftbiosci.com/swift-2s-turbo-dna-library-kits/). For more information about the Swift 2S Turbo Kit on the OT-2, please see our white paper here: [Rapid high quality next generation sequencing library preparation with Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kits on the Opentrons OT-2](https://opentrons-landing-img.s3.amazonaws.com/bundles/fully_automated_ngs_application_note.pdf) 

In this part of the protocol, your [OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2) will complete the indexing portion of the protocol as outlined in the [Swift 2S Turbo Kit Guide](https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRT-001-2S-Turbo-DNA-Library-Kit-Rev-1.pdf).

At the completion of this step, you will have 20Î¼l of supernatant from each sample that contains the final library.

**Using the customizations fields, below set up your protocol.**
* **P300 Multi-Channel Pipette Tip Type**: Select which tips (filter/non-filter) to be used for this protocol.
* **Number of Samples**: Specify the number of samples (8 or 16) you'd like to run.


**Note:** The final elution will be transferred to column 3 (and column 4, if running 16 samples) of the PCR plate in slot 3.


### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
