Part 3 of 3: Final Clean-Up


With this protocol, your [OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2) can perform the [Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit](https://swiftbiosci.com/swift-2s-turbo-dna-library-kits/). For more information about the Swift 2S Turbo Kit and the [Swift 2S Turbo Unique Dual Indexing Primer Kit](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/swift-2s-turbo-unique-dual-indexing-primer-kit-96-rxns?_pos=1&_sid=f1fb599e7&_ss=r) on the OT-2, please see our Application Note here: [Rapid high quality next generation sequencing library preparation with Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kits on the Opentrons OT-2](https://opentrons-landing-img.s3.amazonaws.com/bundles/swift_automated_ngs_application_note.pdf)


In this part of the protocol, your OT-2 will complete the final bead clean-up of the protocol as outlined in the [Swift 2S Turbo Kit Guide](https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRT-001-2S-Turbo-DNA-Library-Kit-Rev-1.pdf).


At the completion of this step, you will have 20μl of elution from each sample that contains the final library.
