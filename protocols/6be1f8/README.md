# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
This protocol preps 3, 384 well control plates for further testing of antibodies as part of a larger ELISA protocol. The protocol can be considered in 3 main parts:

* Serial dilution of antibody from stock
* 96 well block prepped with diluent and mAb207 antibodies
* 96 well block prepped with diluent and mAb210 antibodies
* Transfer of antibody to 3, 384 well control plates

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Mix repetitions`: Specify the number of mix repetitions.
* `Initial volume diluent tubes`: Specify the initial volume in both diluent tubes. This is used for liquid height tracking.
* `P1000 aspirate/dispense flow rate`: Specify the p1000 aspirate and dispense flow rates.
* `P1000 aspiration/dispense bottom clearance (mm)`: Specify the aspiration and dispense clearance from the bottom of the well for the P1000 pipette (to avoid plate pick up). The default value is 1mm from the bottom of the well.
* `Touch tip radius`: Describes the proportion of the target well’s radius. When radius=1.0, the pipette tip will move to the edge of the target well; when radius=0.5, it will move to 50% of the well’s radius. Default: 1.0 (100%)
* `Touch tip v-offset`:  Specify the offset in mm from the top of the well to touch tip A positive offset moves the tip higher above the well, while a negative offset moves it lower into the well Default: -1.0 mm
* `Touch tip speed`:Specify the speed for touch tip motion, in mm/s. Default: 60.0 mm/s, Max:80.0 mm/s, Min: 20.0 mm/s
* `P20 Pipette Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load your pipette.
* `P1000 Pipette Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load your pipette.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
