# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina

## Description
This protocol uses multi-channel P20 and P300 pipettes to perform library prep steps on 8-48 input total RNA samples according to the attached NEB user guide (reagents were combined in a few instances to reduce the number of transfer steps required). User-determined parameters are available to specify the number of samples and the magnet engage height and time.

### Protocol Steps
1. Use settings in the OT app to pre-cool the temperature modules to 4 degrees C prior to running this protocol.
2. The protocol will alert the user to ensure reagents are present on deck in sufficient volume.
3. The p300 multi will mix the total RNA samples and oligo-dT beads.
4. The OT-2 will pause for an off-deck incubation.
5. The p300 multi will mix the total RNA samples and oligo-dT beads.
6. The magnets will engage to pellet the beads. The p300 multi will remove and discard the supernatant.
7. The p300 multi will wash the bead pellets twice with wash buffer.
8. The p300 multi will add 0.1X TE and mix to resuspend the beads.
9. The OT-2 will pause for an off-deck incubation.
10. The p300 multi will add binding buffer to the beads and mix.
11. The magnets will engage to pellet the beads. The p300 multi will remove and discard the supernatant.
12. The p300 multi will wash the bead pellets with wash buffer.
13. The p20 multi will add first strand reaction buffer + random primer to elute the mRNA.
14. The OT-2 will pause for an off-deck incubation.
15. The magnets will engage to pellet the beads. The p20 multi will transfer the elute to the output plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters using the parameters section on this page, then download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
3. Set up your deck and run labware position check using the OT App. For tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
4. Hit 'Run'.
