### Protocol Steps
1. SPRI beads are mixed
2. 100 uL of SPRI beads are added to the samples
3. The samples and beads are mixed
4. The beads are left to incubate for 5 minutes on the samples
5. Magnetic module is engaged for 5 minutes to separate the beads before removing the resulting supernatant
6. Beads are washed twice with 200 uL of ethanol, disposing of ethanol each time
7. Magnetic module is disengaged
8. 41 uL of elution solution is added to the samples and mixed
9. Samples are left to elute for 2 minutes
10. Magnetic module is engaged for 5 minutes to separate beads
11. 40 uL of now eluted sample is transferred to column 4 on the 96 well plate


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
