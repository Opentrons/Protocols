# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* Nucleic Acid Extraction


## Description
This protocol automates the [MGI Easy Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit](https://en.mgitech.cn/Uploads/Temp/file/20200416/5e97edc3ef00b.pdf) and offers the user the ability to modify parameters such as the number of samples and the types of labware used.</br>
</br>
This protocol has been optimized for use on the OT-2 and begins with an empty deepwell plate on the Magnetic Module. Lysis mix is first added to the plate, then samples are transferred to the lysis mix and mixed. Three wash steps occur after this and the protocol concludes with an elution step that results in 75µL of elutes transferred to a clean plate.
</br>
