With this protocol, your robot can perform the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit protocol describe by the [Illumina Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_nextera/nextera-xt/nextera-xt-library-prep-reference-guide-15031942-03.pdf).

This is part 3 of the protocol, which is step (4) normalize libraries. This step normalizes the quantity of each library to ensure more equal library representation in the pooled library.

It is a safe stopping point after this step. If you are stopping, seal the plate and store at -25°C to -15°C for up to seven days.
