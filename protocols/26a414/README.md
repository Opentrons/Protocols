For this protocol, be sure that the pipettes (P10 and P50) are attached.

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* Transfer CSV: Upload your properly formatted (see below) CSV.
* P10 Single Mount: Specify which mount the P10 is on (left or right).
* P50 Single Mount: Specify which mount the P50 is on (left or right).

**Note about CSV**

The CSV should be formatted like so:

`Well` | `Guanidine Amount (µL)` | `PBS Amount (µL)`

The first row (A1, B1, C1) can contain headers (like above) or simply have the desired information. All of the following rows should just have the necessary information.
