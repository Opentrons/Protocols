# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* MagMAX Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit

## Description
This protocol automates the wash steps of the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. As inputs, it requires a deep well plate with sample beads, a single well trough of 80% ethanol, a single well trough of wash buffer, a single well trash, and an output 96 well plate.

There are 2 pauses during the protocol that require human intervention - to drain the liquid trash + to replace tip racks + to add elution buffer, and to add the deep well plate to a 65c incubator for 10 minutes.

## Process
1. Load reagents to deck. At least 50ml of wash buffer are required per run, and at least 75ml of 80% ethanol.
2. After second ethanol wash step, drain liquid trash, replace tip boxes, and replace 80% ethanol with at least 5-6ml of elution buffer.
3. After samples are resuspended in elution solution, move deep well plate to a 65c incubator for 10 minutes.
4. Move samples back to magdeck. Samples will be eluted into the 96 well plate on deck position 5.
