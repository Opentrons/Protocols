Part 2 of 3: Ligation Clean-Up & PCR Prep


With this protocol, your [OT-2](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/ot-2) can perform the [Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kit](https://swiftbiosci.com/swift-2s-turbo-dna-library-kits/). For more information about the Swift 2S Turbo Kit and the [Swift 2S Turbo Unique Dual Indexing Primer Kit](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/swift-2s-turbo-unique-dual-indexing-primer-kit-96-rxns?_pos=1&_sid=f1fb599e7&_ss=r) on the OT-2, please see our Application Note here: [Rapid high quality next generation sequencing library preparation with Swift 2S Turbo DNA Library Kits on the Opentrons OT-2](https://opentrons-landing-img.s3.amazonaws.com/bundles/swift_automated_ngs_application_note.pdf)


In this part of the protocol, your OT-2 will complete the ligation process that was begun in [Part 1](http://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/swift-2s-turbo-pt1) and complete the indexing portion up to the thermocycling step (step 18) as outlined in the [Swift 2S Turbo Kit Guide](https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRT-001-2S-Turbo-DNA-Library-Kit-Rev-1.pdf).


At the completion of this step, you will add your samples to the thermocycler. Once the thermocycler step is complete, continue with [Part 3 of the protocol](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/swift-2s-turbo-pt3).

*Specific to Part 2 of 3*


Slot 1: [NEST 96-Well PCR Plate](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/lab-plates/products/nest-0-1-ml-96-well-pcr-plate-full-skirt) (or PCR Strips) on top of [96-Well Aluminum Block](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/racks-and-adapters/products/aluminum-block-set) with samples the user has collected from [Part 1](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/swift-2s-turbo-pt1)
* 8 Samples: Column 1
* 16 Samples: Columns 1 & 2
* 24 Samples: Columns 1, 2, & 3

Slot 2: [NEST 12-Well Reservoir](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/reservoirs/products/nest-12-well-reservoir-15-ml)
* A1: Magnetic Beads
* A3: 80% Ethanol Solution, Freshly Prepared
* A4: 80% Ethanol Solution, Freshly Prepared
