With this protocol, your robot can perform the NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep as described by the [NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® Instruction Manual](https://www.neb.com/-/media/catalog/datacards-or-manuals/manuale7770.pdf) with a custom magnet rack. You will need to manually transfer the PCR plate to-and-from the magnet.

The PCR plates used in this specific protocol is the [Hard-Shell® 96-well PCR plates](http://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/sku/hss9601-hard-shell-96-well-pcr-plates-high-profile-semi-skirted-clear-clear?ID=HSS9601).
