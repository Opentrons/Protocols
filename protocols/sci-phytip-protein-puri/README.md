# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Protein Purification
	* Protein A, Pro Plus, Pro Plus LX Columns

## Description
This protocol (Protein Purification) performs protein purification by conducting dual flow chromatography using PhyTip® Protein A, ProPlus or
ProPlus LX Columns on the OT-2. It is developed to process up to 96 samples (a full 96-well plate).


Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify number of samples (1-96) for this run.
* `P300 Multi-Channel Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 Multi-Channel pipette.

### Deck Setup
* Slot 2 – 96-well V-bottom plate – Samples
* Slot 3 - PhyTip® Columns in an Opentrons 300µL Tipbox
* Slot 5 – 96-well V-bottom plate – 1st wash
* Slot 7 - 96-well V-bottom plate - 2nd wash
* Slot 9 - 96-well V-bottom plate - equilibration
* Slot 11 - 96-well V-bottom plate - elution

### Reagent Setup
1. Prepare the sample plate (200 uL/well)
2. Fill the reagent plates with buffers according to the number of samples
to be processed.
a. Equilibration buffer – 200 uL per well
b. Wash buffer 1 – 200 uL per well
c. Wash buffer 2 – 200 uL per well
d. Elution buffer – 80 uL per well
3. Fill an Opentrons 300µL Tipbox with PhyTip® Columns according to the
number of samples to be processed.

* For example: reagents and tips set for 72 samples (9 columns)

### Protocol Steps
1. Pick up PhyTip® Columns (slot 3).
2. Equilibrate – passing equilibration buffer (slot 9) over the resin bed for 4 cycles. In each cycle, the pipetting is programmed to aspirate and dispense 180 uL at 240 uL/min.
3. Capture – pass the sample (slot 2) over the resin bed for 8 cycles. In each cycle, the pipetting is programmed to aspirate and dispense 180 uL at 240 uL/min.
4. Wash – pass wash buffer 1 (slot 5) over the resin bed for 2 cycles. In each cycle, the pipetting is programmed to aspirate and dispense 180 uL at 480 uL/min.
5. Wash again – pass wash buffer 2 (slot 7) over the resin bed for 2
cycles. In each cycle, the pipetting is programmed to aspirate and
dispense 180 uL at 480 uL/min.
6. Elute - pass elution buffer (slot 11) over the resin bed for 4 cycles. In each cycle, the pipetting is programmed to aspirate and dispense 130 uL at 240 uL/min.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
