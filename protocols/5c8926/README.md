## Description
This protocol is an update to [this protocol](http://protocol-delivery.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/1617). The update includes added labware (Corning 384-well plate) and the option to use Opentrons tips or TipOne tips. The original protocol performs cherrypicking from source to target plates as specified in an input CSV file. The protocol parses the CSV for slots to load the source and target plates. Only non-zero volume transfers are carried out for efficiency, and the user is prompted to refill tipracks if necessary.
