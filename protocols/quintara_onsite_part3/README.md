# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling


## Description
1 of 6 mastermixes is filled into all 108 columns in all 9 plates from two wells of a reservoir. Pipette will automatically be assigned depending on the mastermix selected, and multi-dispensing is installed when possible to the pipette maximum volume. Mastermix is taken back and forth between the two mastermix wells (aspirate A1, aspirate A2, aspirate A1,..., etc.), so fill mastermix source columns in the reservoir evenly. Mastermix details are included in the dropdown menu.

### Protocol Steps
1. Aspirate mastermix volume according to mastermix selected.
2. Dispense into all wells, multi-dispensing if possible.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
