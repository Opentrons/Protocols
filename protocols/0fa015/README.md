## Description
This protocol fills[NEST 96-Well PCR Plate](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-0-1-ml-96-well-pcr-plate-full-skirt) with QE using a [GEN2 Multi-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes).</br>
</br>
The protocol can fill up to 9 plates and will dispense 10ÂµL of QE into each well</br>
</br>
This protocol is based largely on [this protocol](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/17cb2d) and will employ similar behaviors (touch tip after aspiration, blow out, and aspiration at the top of the well to prevent cross-contamination).
