# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol automates the transfer of PCR mix and samples from up to four 96-well elution plates to a 384-well plate. It follows a specific format detailed in the image below. Columns from the 96 well elution plates correspond to specific wells on the 384 well plate. Each elution plate contains a control that is also transferred into the 384-well plate. For runs that have less than four plates, the controls will need to be added manually for the corresponding elution plate. This protocol is version 2 of the original protocol which can be access [here](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/6e2509).
