# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Illumina DNA Prep

## Description
This protocol is part 1 of a 3 part series which preps a 96 well Bio-Rad 200ul plate with diluted DNA and mastermix in accordance with the [Ilumina DNA Prep Kit](https://emea.support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/illumina_prep/illumina-dna-prep-reference-guide-1000000025416-09.pdf). DNA is diluted with water before mastermix is added. Find part 2 and part 3 of protocol below:

* [Part 2: Post Tagmentation Cleanup](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0bf4f4-pt2)
* [Part 3: Cleanup libraries](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/0bf4f4-pt3)

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of samples`: Specify the number of samples for this run.
* `P300 Tip Start Column on Slot 8 (1-12)`: One column of the 200ul tip rack will be used per run. Specify which column to pick up tips from for this run.
* `P20 Multi-Channel GEN2 Mount`: Specify which side (left or right) the P20 multi channel pipette is mounted.
* `P300 Multi Channel GEN2 Mount`: Specify which side (left or right) the P300 multi channel pipette is mounted.

### Deck Setup

* Deck setup with a full plate of samples. Mastermix is always kept in column 1 regardless of number of samples, as is water in the first column of the Nest 12 well reservoir.

### Protocol Steps
1. 10ul of water is added to each column, up to the number specified, in the empty plate in slot 3.
2. DNA is premixed for 10 repetitions before 5ul is transferred to the plate on slot 3 for each column containing water.
3. DNA and water is mixed.
4. Mastermix is added to water/DNA mixture, with a premix of mastermix step for every 3 columns that are transferred.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
