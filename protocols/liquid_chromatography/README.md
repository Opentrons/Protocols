## Description
This is a liquid chromatography protocol that uses a custom container called a TLC-plate (85.5mm x 127.75mm) 10 rows x 14 columns
___
1. Home and calibrate positions (maybe most important for "TLC-plate" container?)
2. Pick up tip on 200ul pipette
3. Transfer 780uL from "Acetonitrile" to "AMW"
4. Trash tip and pick up a new one on 200ul pipette
5. Transfer 390uL from "Methanol" to "AMW"
6. Trash tip and pick up a new one on 200ul pipette
7. Transfer 156uL from "Water" to "AMW"
8. Mix "AMW" 5 times (200uL)
9. Transfer 360uL from "AMW" to "81p8uM"
10. Transfer 360uL from "AMW" to "9p09uM"
11. Transfer 150uL from "AMW" to "2098nM"
12. Trash tip

13. Pick up new tip on 50uL pipette
14. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "1049nM"
15. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "525nM"
16. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "262nM"
17. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "131nM"

20. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "16p4nM"
21. Transfer 45uL from "AMW" to "8p2nM"
22. Trash tip, new tip on 50ul pipette
23. Transfer 45uL from "DOX900uM" to "81p8uM"
24. Trash tip, new tip on 50ul pipette
25. Transfer 45uL from "DOL900uM" to "81p8uM"
26. Trash tip, new tip on 50ul pipette

28. Mix "81p8uM" 10 times (50uL)
29. Transfer 45uL from "81p8uM" to "9p09uM"
30. Mix "9p09uM" 5 times (50uL)
31. Transfer 45uL from "9p09uM" to "2098nM"
32. Mix "2098nM" 5 times (50uL)
33. Transfer 45uL from "2098nM" to "1049nM"
34. Mix "1049nM" 5 times (50uL)
35. Transfer 45uL from "1049nM" to "525nM"
36. Mix "525nM" 5 times (50uL)
37. Transfer 45uL from "525nM" to "262nM"
38. Mix "262nM" 5 times (50uL)
39. Transfer 45uL from "262nM" to "131nM"
40. Mix "131nM" 5 times (50uL)
41. Transfer 45uL from "131nM" to "65p6nM"
42. Mix "65p6nM" 5 times (50uL)
43. Transfer 45uL from "65p6nM" to "32p8nM"
44. Mix "32p8nM" 5 times (50uL)
45. Transfer 45uL from "32p8nM" to "16p4nM"
46. Mix "16p4nM" 5 times (50uL)
47. Transfer 45uL from "16p4nM" to "8p2nM"
48. Mix "8p2nM" 5 times (50uL)
49. Trash tip

For the following transfers dispense rate needs to be very slow e.g. 1uL/s

50. New tip on 50uL pipette
51. Transfer 5uL from "2098nM" to position A1 on "TLC-plate"
52. Trash tip and replace with new one

54. Trash tip and replace with new one
55. Transfer 5uL from "525nM" to position C1 on "TLC-plate"
56. Trash tip and replace with new one
57. Transfer 5uL from "262nM" to position D1 on "TLC-plate"
58. Trash tip and replace with new one
59. Transfer 5uL from "131nM" to position E1 on "TLC-plate"
60. Trash tip and replace with new one
61. Transfer 5uL from "65p6nM" to position F1 on "TLC-plate"
