# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* Arcis Blood Kit


## Description
**Note: This is an updated version (apiV1 to apiV2) of [this protocol](https://protocol-delivery.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/arcis-test)**

This protocol is designed for running tests with the Arcis Blood Kit (further instructions about the protocol can be found [here](http://www.arcisbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arcis-Blood-kit-Bulk-kit-UFL005-50rxn-IFU-Rev-6.12.2018.pdf)). With the Arcis Blood Kit, nucleic acid investigations can be performed easily and efficiently with the two included reagents. This protocol calls for the use of a P50-Single and P300-Single pipettes, as well as Opentrons Tube Racks, Corning 96-well, 360μL flat plate, and two Bioplastics 100μL plates.
