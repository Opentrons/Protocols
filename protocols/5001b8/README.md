# Enzymatic Assay

## Description
This protocol performs a custom enzymatic assay on a temperature module-mounted deepwell plate and a temperature module-mounted PCR plate. Substrates 1-8 are transferred in order to column 1 of the deepwell plate, and substrates 9-16 are transferred in order to column 2 of the deepwell plate. The user is prompted to note times throughout the protocol.

For further instructions on setting up your 2 temperature modules for simultaneous use, please see 'Additional Notes' below. Note that during setup, temperature module 1 will be set to 37C (for the deepwell plate), and temperature module 2 will be set to 4C (for the PCR plate).

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the respective mount sides for your P50 multi- and P300 single-channel pipette.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
Instructions for setting up your 2 temperature modules:
1. Plug in Module 1 to a power source, power it on and connect the USB cable to a port on your robot.
2. SSH into your robot:  
	* If you are using MacOS, open terminal and run ssh root@ROBOT_IP (replace ROBOT_IP with your robot's IP).
	* If you are using Windows:  
		* Download putty installer from [this link](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
		* Install and then open Putty
		* Under "Host Name (or IP address)", enter IP address found under "Connectivity" in "Robot" tab of the app. Note: do not enter a slash or numbers following a slash.
		* Ensure "Port" is 22 and "Connection type" is SSH
		* Click "Open" at the bottom
		* When terminal window pops up asking who to log in as, type in root and press enter
		* [Putty settings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/87bucxl2wqmo2is/Screenshot%202018-06-25%2013.57.19.png?dl=0)
	* Once you see the Opentrons logo, you have successfully SSHâ€™d into the robot.
3. Find the device path of Module 1 by running `ls /dev/ttyACM*`
4. Use the device path in your protocol line 27.
5. Unplug Module 1, and plug in Module 2.
6. Repeat steps 3-4 to find the device path and replace it in line 10.
7. You can now safely exit the Terminal or Command Prompt.
8. Plug in Module 1 again, and you should now be able to control the Modules independently with your protocol.
