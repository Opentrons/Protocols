## Description
With this protocol, you can perform high-quality nucleic acid purifcations using magnetic beads and the [Opentrons Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/magdeck?_ga=2.120183432.1039841802.1542049668-403439593.1535387376). This protocol contains several parameters that you can customize for many different magnetic bead and nucleic acid types. Use this setup to iterate and optimize your magbead-based workflows!

You can use any magnetic beads you prefer with this protocol, but we do have reagent recommendations in the **Materials Neeeded** section below to help you get started. For more detailed information on how to use this protocol, please see our [Technical Note](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/Technical+Notes/Nucleic+Acid+Purification+with+Magnetic+Module+OT2+Technical+Note.pdf).

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol as follows:

   * **Pipette:** Specify your pipette. We recommend using a p50 or p300 multi- or single-channel.
   * **Pipette Mount:** Specify which mount (left or right) your pipette is on.
   * **Sample number:** Customize the number of samples to run per protocol. A multiple of 8 is recommended when you are using a multichannel pipette.
   * **Sample volume:** Specify the starting volume (in uL) of the input sample.
   * **Bead Ratio:** Customize the ratio of beads for left or right side size-selection of fragments. *The default bead ratio is 1.8x the input sample volume.*
   * **Elution Volume:** Specify the final volume (in uL) to elute the purified nucleic acid. *The Opentrons MagDeck supports elution volumes above 10 ÂµL.*
   * **Incubation Time:** Specify the amount of time (in minutes) that the bead solution and input sample interact.
   * **Settling Time:** Specify the amount of time (in minutes) needed to pellet the beads. *Higher volumes may require a longer settling time.*
   * **Drying Time:** Specify the drying time (in minutes) needed after wash steps.
