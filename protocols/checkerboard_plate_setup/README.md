## Process
1. Aspirate 125 uL of solution X1 into 8-channel pipette (P300) from location T1 and dispense 125 uL into T5. -> T5 now contains 1000uL of X1.
2. Dispose P300 pipette tips in tip disposal container.
3. Aspirate 125 uL of solution X2 into 8-channel pipette (P300) from location T2 and dispense 125 uL into T5. -> T5 now contains 1000uL of X1 and 1000uL of X2.
4. Mix solutions in T5 through multiple cycles (10x) of aspiration and dispensing with 8-channel pipette.
5. Dispose P300 pipette tips in tip disposal container.
6. Aspirate 125 uL of solution Y1 into 8-channel pipette (P300) from location T3 and dispense 125 uL into T6. -> T6 now contains 1000uL of Y1.
7. Dispose P300 pipette tips in tip disposal container.
8. Aspirate 125 uL of solution Y2 into 8-channel pipette (P300) from location T4 and dispense 125 uL into T6. -> T6 now contains 1000uL of Y1 and 1000uL of Y2.
9. Mix solutions in T6 through multiple cycles (10x) of aspiration and dispensing with 8-channel pipette.
10. Dispose P300 pipette tips in tip disposal container.
11. Aspirate 295 uL of reagent into 8-channel pipette (P300) from reagent reservoir and dispense into column 1 of 1st microplate.
12. Repeat step 11 until both microplates have 295 uL of reagent in each well.
13. Dispose P300 pipette tips in tip disposal container.
14. Aspirate 5 uL of solution X into single-channel pipette (P10) from location T5, dispense into a blue well (see pdf), mix through multiple cycles (3x) of aspiration and dispensing, dispose P10 pipette tip in tip disposal container.
15. Repeat step 14 for all blue wells (see pdf).
16. Aspirate 5 uL of solution Y into single-channel pipette (P10) from location T6, dispense into an orange well (see pdf), mix through multiple cycles (3x) of aspiration and dispensing, dispose P10 pipette tip in tip disposal container.
17. Repeat step 16 for all orange wells (see pdf).
