## Description
This protocol automates the distribution of assays from a 48-well reservoir to 9, 96-well plates.</br>
</br>
Using the customizable parameters below, you can specify which column to start picking up tips from and how many *"runs"* to perform. During each *run*, all 9 plates will be filled with assay from the reservoir. At the conclusion of filling the 9 plates, the OT-2 will flash, pause, and prompt the user to replace the plates on the deck.</br>
</br>
This protocol uses custom labware definitions for the 48-well reservoir (Agilent) and 96-well plate (MicroAmp Endura). When downloading the protocol, the labware definitions (a JSON file) will be included for use with this protocol. For more information on using custom labware on the OT-2, please see this article: [Using labware in your protocols](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols)
