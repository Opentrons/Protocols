# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* ELISA


## Description
This protocol automates the Alpco Insulin ELISA protocol. The protocol begins by transferring aliquots of samples, standards, and controls. The rest of the protocol can be automated or include manual interventions (for wash steps and off-deck incubations). Please note this protocol is currently being optimized.</br>
</br>
**Update:** This protocol was updated on September 8, 2022</br>
</br>

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* **Number of Samples**: Specify the number of samples
* **P300 Multi-Channel Mount**: Select which mount the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette is attached to (the Single-Channel Pipette should be attached to the opposite mount)

### Deck Setup

</br>
</br>
Standards and Controls will be transferred to the first column of each 96-well plate and their duplicate in the second column. After the Standards and Controls have been added, each sample will be added in duplicate (to the well immediately to the right of the initial target destination). Please see below for an example of the resulting plate layout with one sample.

### Reagent Setup
Please note, that if using more than 40 samples, all reagents for the 2nd 96-well plate should be filled in the column to the right of the column illustrated below (columns 2, 5, and 8)

### Protocol Steps
1. Transfer of 25µL of Standards and Controls into column 1 of the Destination Plate(s). Followed by 25µL aliquots of samples into two columns for each column of samples.
2. 100µL of Detection Antibody is added to Destination Plate.
3. User is prompted to remove plate from OT-2 and place on shaker for 1 hour incubation.
4. 100µL of TMB Substrate is added to the Destination Plate.
5. User is prompted to remove plate from OT-2 and place on shaker for 15 minute incubation.
6. 100µL of Stop Solution is added to the Destination Plate.
7. Protocol complete.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
