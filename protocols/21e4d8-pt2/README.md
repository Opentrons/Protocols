### Author
[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/)


# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Twist Library Prep


## Description
This protocol is [part two](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt2) of a three-part series to automate the [Twist Library Prep protocol](https://www.twistbioscience.com/sites/default/files/resources/2019-09/Protocol_NGS_EnzymaticFragUniversalAdapterSystem_11Sep19_Rev1.pdf). See below for all three parts:</br>
</br>
Part 1: [Fragmentation & Repair](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt1)</br>
Part 2: [Ligate Adapters](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt2)</br>
Part 3: [PCR Amplification](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt3)</br>
</br>
The final plate from [part one](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt1) should be run through the thermocycler program outlined in the [Twist Library Prep protocol](https://www.twistbioscience.com/sites/default/files/resources/2019-09/Protocol_NGS_EnzymaticFragUniversalAdapterSystem_11Sep19_Rev1.pdf) before being moved back to the OT-2 for this protocol.</br>
</br>
This protocol begins by adding 5µL of the Twist Universal Adapters to each well containing samples from [part one](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt1), followed by the addition of 45µL of Ligation Master Mix. The user is then prompted to remove plate and incubate the samples on a thermocycler. Following incubation, the user will return the plate to the OT-2 for a fully-automated magbead-based wash process (2 times) that will result in the 15µL of supernatant transferred to labware selected by the user. The user should then take the labware containing the supernatant and run on the thermocycler before moving to [part three](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/21e4d8-pt3).</br>
