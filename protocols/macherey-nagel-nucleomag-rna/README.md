This protocol automates the NucleoMag RNA kit for flexible magnetic bead based isolation of RNA from tissue and cell samples.

Before beginning the protocol on the OT-2, the following preparation steps are needed.
1. Perform the lysis accoding to the NucleoMag® RNA user manual.
2. Prepare the rDNase reaction mixture according to the NucleoMag® RNA user manual.
3. Fill the 12-Well Buffer Reservoir according to the table below.
4. Resuspend the NucleoMag B-Beads by vortexing and place them in Position A1 of the 2mL Tube Rack.
5. Load the instrument deck according to the displayed positions.
6. Place the Square-well Block containing the lysates on the Magnetic Module and start the run.
