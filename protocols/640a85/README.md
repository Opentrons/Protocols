## Description
This protocol performs a custom PCR preparation on DNA samples in triplicate using pre-created mastermix.

DNA samples should be arranged down columns before moving across rows (sample 1 in plate well A1, sample 2 in plate well B1, ..., sample 9 in plate well A2, etc.).

## Process
1. Input the respective mount sides for your P300 multi-channel and P20 GEN2 single-channel pipettes and the number of DNA samples to process (1-96).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
