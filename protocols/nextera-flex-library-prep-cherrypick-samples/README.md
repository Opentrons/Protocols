## Description
This protocol cherrypicks samples from up to 9 Olympus PCR source plates to 1 Bio-Rad Hard Shell PCR destination plate as preparation for the the [Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep protocol](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/nextera-dna-flex.html). The CSV should be formatted in the following format, **including the header line:**

```
Source plate (1-9), Source well (A1-H12), Destination well (A1-H12)
1, A1, A1
1, C5, A2
3, H9, A3
9, E3, B1
```

Preprogram the thermocycler according to the BLT PCR program parameters described in the kit manual.

4x6 aluminum block tuberack (slot 4, mounted on temperature module)
* A1-C1: mastermix 1.5ml snapcap tubes (loaded empty, 1 tube needed per 32 samples)
* A2-D2: EPM in 0.5ml false-bottom tubes (1 tube needed per 24 samples)
* A3-B3: nuclease-free water in 1.5ml snapcap tubes (1 tube needed per 48 samples)

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input your pipette type and mount, your cherrypicking CSV, the volume to cherrypick (in ul), and the starting tip position.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
