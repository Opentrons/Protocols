## Description
This protocol automates the creation of a mastermix (containing OptiMEM, DNA samples, and Viafect) and then dispenses this mastermix in triplicate. Using a simple CSV and a couple key parameters, this protocol can be easily adjusted for diifferent scenarios.</br>
</br>
The protocol begins by adding 5.3µL of OptiMEM to the number of wells as defined by the user (the last well can receive more). After this, 4.4µL of DNA will be added to the wells per the CSV, transferring from sample tubes in deck slot 4 to the mastermix tubes in deck slot 5 (with OptiMEM). The OT-2 will then add 1.3µL of Viafect to the mastermix wells and pause until the user is ready to resume. After resuming, the OT-2 will transfer 10µL of the mastermix, in triplicate, to a 96-well plate in deck slot 6.</br>

Slot 7: [Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack Set](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) with a [1.5mL Microcentrifuge Tube](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-consumables/products/nest-microcentrifuge-tubes) containing OptiMEM in D6</br>
</br>
**Using the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.**
* **Transfer CSV**: Upload a CSV that will dictate the transfer of DNA from deck slot 4 to deck slot 5 (see below for more detail)
* **Number of Mastermix**: Specify the number of mastermixes to be created (1-32).
* **Extra OptiMEM**: Specify whether the last mastermix tube should receive 31.7µL of OptiMEM or the standard 5.3µL
</br>
</br>
**CSV Layout**</br>
![CSV Template](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/6b9ee3/6b9ee3_csv_img.png)
</br>
</br>
The CSV should consist of two columns with headers, **Source Well** and **Destination Well**. Using capital letters, you can simply put well locations and the pipette will transfer 4.4µL from the source well (in deck slot 4) to the destination well (in deck slot 5).
