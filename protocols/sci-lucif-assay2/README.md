## Description
The protocol performs liquid handling to conduct transient DNA transfection to develop reporter cells in a 96-well setting for luciferase reporter assay. Multiple transfection master mixes can be used (e.g., different DNA vectors or various reagent concentrations are tested), and the user determines how many columns of cells (12 columns in a 96-well plate, 8 wells per column) are subjected to a master mix.

The luciferase reporter assay is used to investigate the regulation of expression of a gene of interest. This method relies on reporter cells created by stable or transient transfection of a promoter-driven, luciferase-expressing DNA. The bioluminescence proportional to luciferase expression can be quantified to assess the functional connection between the expression of the target gene which is controlled by this promoter, and the factor to be studied which may exhibit a regulatory effect on the cell behaviors at the transcription level. In this particular example, HeLa cells are stably or transiently transfected with an NF-kB promoter-driven, luciferase reporter construct, treated with an NF-kB activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and activation of NF-kB assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity.

Transfection reagent preparation:
The table below lists examples of transfection master mix preparation. To make the reagent for 100 reactions (sufficient for a 96-well plate), dilute 10 uL (0.1 uL per reaction) of NanoLuc Reporter Vector with NF-κB Response Element (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 1 mL (10 uL per reaction) serum free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then add 30 uL (0.3 uL per reaction) of FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After 10-minute incubation at room temperature, the total volume of this transfection reagent/DNA mixture is brought up to 2 mL by adding serum free DMEM. All master mixes are kept in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes with snap cap, loaded on Opentrons 24 Tube Rack.
