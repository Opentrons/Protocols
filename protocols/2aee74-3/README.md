This protocol accomplishes part 3/3: Detection for the [Olink Target 96 protocol](https://www.olink.com/products-services/target/) for protein biomarker discovery. Primers are transferred to the left 96 wells of the Fluidigm detection plate, and samples are transferred to the right 96 wells. The transfer mapping for these plates is shown in the following images:

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
