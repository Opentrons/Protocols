## Description
This protocol utilizes a user-specified CSV to transfer sample using a variety of labware. With this protocol you have the ability to choose between the following:

* Starlab Deepwell Plate
* Eppendorf 2mL Tube in Tube Rack
* Eppendorf 1.5mL Tube in Tube Rack
* NEST 96-Well, 200µL Flat
* NEST 96-Well, 100µL PCR
* BioRad 96-Well, 200µL PCR
* Corning 96-Well, 360µL Flat
* Corning 384-Well, 112µL Flat
* USA Scientific 96-Deepwell, 2.4mL

With the destination labware providing the same options as source labware.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Volumes CSV`: Here, you should upload a .csv file formatted in the following way, being sure to include the header line:

`Source Well` | `Volume` | `Destination Well`

**Note about CSV**: The first column is dedicated to the header of the CSV; thus, the first row of data should occupy cells 'A2', 'B2', and 'C2' in the document.

* `Pipette Model`: Select which pipette you will use for this protocol.
* `Pipette Mount`: Specify which mount your single-channel pipette is on (left or right).
* `Source Labware Type`: Select which (destination) labware you will use for this protocol.
* `Destination Labware Type`: Select which (destination) labware you will use for this protocol.
* `Tip Use Strategy`: Select whether you would like to use the same tip or a new tip for each transfer.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pipette will aspirate a user-specified volume at the designated labware and well according to the imported csv file.
2. Pipette will dispense this volume into user-specified labware and well according to the imported csv file.
3. Steps 1 and 2 repeated over the duration of the CSV file. 

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
