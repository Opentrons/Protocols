## Description
This protocol allows your robot to perform a NGS library prep in whole 96-well plates: which include the steps (1) blund-end repair, (2) adapter addition, (3) ligase, (4) fill-in, and (5) purification with beads. This protocol would require a P10 single-channel pipette and a P300 multi-channel pipette, as well as a [temperature](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/tempdeck) and [magnetic](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) module.

### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Module
* [TempDeck](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/tempdeck)
* [MagDeck](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck)

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
During the protocol, the program will pause and prompt the user to replace the tipracks. Resume the protocol after the tipracks have been refilled.
