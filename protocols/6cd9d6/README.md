# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Custom

## Description
This protocol performs a custom NGS Library Prep. It utilizes two temperature modules in Slot 1 and Slot 3 for the cooling of reagents. It also utilizes the magnetic module for bead based purification of samples.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `P20 Multichannel GEN2 Mount Position`: Choose the mount position of the P20 Multichannel GEN2 pipette.
* `P300 Multichannel GEN2 Mount Position`: Choose the mount position of the P300 Multichannel GEN2 pipette.
* `Number of Samples`: Enter total number of samples in the protocol run. **Note: Because both pipettes are 8-channels, the number of samples should be a multiple of 8, otherwise it will use up additional tips for an entire column.**

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
