## Description
This protocol creates a custom PCR prep protocol. The input into this protocol is an elution plate of purified DNA, and the output is PCR strips containing the samples mixed with mastermix.
Using a [Single-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette), this protocol will begin by creating reaction mix in a 2ml tube. Samples will then be transferred from their plate to the qPCR plate and mixed with the reaction mix.

You can select any of the 5 mastermix compositions shown below:
