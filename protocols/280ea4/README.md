# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep

## Description
This protocol creates a custom PCR prep protocol. The input into this protocol is an elution plate of purified DNA, and the output is PCR strips containing the samples mixed with mastermix.
Using a [Single-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette), this protocol will begin by creating reaction mix in a 2ml tube. Samples will then be transferred from their plate to the qPCR plate and mixed with the reaction mix.

You can select any of the 5 mastermix compositions shown below:

## Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
