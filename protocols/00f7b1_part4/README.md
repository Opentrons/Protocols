### Protocol Steps
0. Temperature module cools down to 4 C (this can be done manually prior to protocol start)
1. 8 uL of strand specificity reagent is added from the temperature module in slot 3, column 1 to all samples
2. 2 uL of enzyme mix is added from the temperature module in slot 3, column 3 to all samples then mixed to combine
3. Protocol is complete, OT-2 will flash to alert user


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
