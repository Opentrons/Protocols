## Description
This protocol is part 2 of 2-part protocol designed to transfer biofluids and add the necessary reagents for preparation. After completing part 1 of the robot protocol and the centrifugation step, the samples are placed back on the deck of the OT-2 and this protocol is run. In this part, the samples, that are in the Nanosep Ultrafiltration tubes, are distributed to the sample vials and 0.5mL centrifuge tubes.
