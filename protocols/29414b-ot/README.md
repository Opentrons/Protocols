# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Getting Started
	* Calibration


## Description
This protocol is designed for testing calibration of the OT-2 with a custom tube holder, holding 500µL tubes from Simport Scientific, with Opentrons Tips. This protocol can be used for testing the **P300 Single Channel Pipette** or the **P300 Multi Channel Pipette**.

If testing the P300 Single Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5µL from A1 to A2, A3, and A4 with a 200µL filter tip. The robot will then make transfers with 200µL filter tips, first 50µL from B1 to B2, B3, and B4; then 200µL from C1, to C2, C3, and C4.

If testing the P300 Multi Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5µL from column 1 to column 2, 3, and 4 with 200µL filter tips. The robot will then make transfers with 200µL filter tips, first 50µL from column 5 to column 6, 7, and 8; then 200µL from column 9 to column 10, 11, and 12.

For this protocol, be sure that the correct pipette (P300 Single or Multi) is attached for the intended test case.

**Labware Setup**

Slot 1: [Opentrons 200µL Filter Tips](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/opentrons-200ul-filter-tips)

Slot 3: [Simport Scientific 500µL Tubes in Custom Holder](http://www.simport.com/en/products/173-t100-1.html)

**Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.**
* Pipette Type: Select either `Single Channel` or `Multi Channel`. This will also modify the protocol behavior to the corresponding test protocol.
* Pipette Mount: Specify which mount the P300 is on (left or right).
* Touch Tip (After Aspiration): Select `yes` to perform a touch-tip after aspirating from source well.
* Touch Tip (After Dispense): Select `yes` to perform a touch-tip after dispensing into source well.
