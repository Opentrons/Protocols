## Description
This protocol performs mastermix and DNA sample transfer to a custom 384-well plate. All DNA samples are transferred in quadruplicate in adjacent wells forming 2x2 well squares on the 384-well plate (12x8 squares mapping to the 12x8 input from the 96-well DNA plate), as in the following image:
