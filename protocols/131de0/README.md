# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
*  PCR
	* PCR Prep

## Description
This protocol performs mastermix and DNA sample transfer to a custom 384-well plate. All DNA samples are transferred in quadruplicate in adjacent wells forming 2x2 well squares on the 384-well plate (12x8 squares mapping to the 12x8 input from the 96-well DNA plate), as in the following image:

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the mount side for your P10 multi-channel GEN1 pipette and the number of DNA samples to process (1-96, processed in columns of 8).
2. Download your protocol package.
3. Upload your custom labware and protocol script into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
