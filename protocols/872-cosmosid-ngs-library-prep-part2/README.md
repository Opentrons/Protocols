With this protocol, your robot can perform the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit protocol describe by the [Illumina Reference Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_nextera/nextera-xt/nextera-xt-library-prep-reference-guide-15031942-03.pdf).

This is part 2 of the protocol, which is step (3) clean up libraries. This step uses AMPure XP beads to purify the library DNA and remove short library fragments.

It is a safe stopping point after this step. If you are stopping, seal the plate and store at -25°C to -15°C for up to seven days.

### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Reagents

## Process
1. Input your number of samples (make sure it is consistent with part 1).
2. Input your desired volume of the PCR product.
3. Input your desired bead ratio (use 1.8 if the input size is in the range 300-500 bp, use 0.6 if greater 500 bp).
4. Input your desired dry time.
5. Download your protocol.
6. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
7. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
8. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
9. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
