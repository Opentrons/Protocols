## Description

This is a demo protocol, intended for using the [Opentrons Thermocycler Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/thermocycler-module) as a thermocycler. This protocol does not involve any liquid handling, so no pipettes are required to run this protocol. If you are interested in a custom protocol that uses the thermocycler to your lab's specific needs, you can request one from our Applications Engineering Team, using the [Protocol Request Form](https://opentrons-protocol-dev.paperform.co/).


With this protocol, you can create steps for a a custom thermocycler profile.


Additionally, you can specify the lid temperature, sample volume per well, and a final hold temperature that will stay set until you're ready to move the samples.

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

The Thermocycler Module should be loaded into its default position in slots 7 and 10 (with some overhang in slots 8 and 11).


Before running the protocol with samples, use the button on top of the Thermocycler to open the lid (if closed) and place your sample plate into the Thermocycler. If needed, place an [Opentrons Thermocycler Seal](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/thermocycler-seals) on the lid. You do not need to close the lid before running the protocol.


**How to setup your Thermocycler profiles**
1. Download the template file [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/thermocycler/Thermocycler+Template.csv)
2. Open the `.csv` file in a your spreadsheet editor of choice (Google Sheets, Excel, Numbers, etc.)
3. Export the edited file as `.csv`
4. Upload the new file in the field "profile .csv file" below.
