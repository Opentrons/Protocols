### Protocol Steps
1. 20, 2, 2, and 20ul are transferred from A1, A3, A5, A7 of the 384 plate to column 1 of the 96 plate.
2. Same volumes are transferred from A9, A11, A13, and A15 to column 2 of the 96 plate.
3. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until the end of the plate is reached for that row to subsequent destination columns.
4. Steps 1, 2, and 3 are repeated for start wells A2, B1, and B2. 


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
