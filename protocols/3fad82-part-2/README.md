With this protocol, your robot can perform a modified Quarter Volume NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina protocol described by the [Experimental Protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-05-07/ia13rz0/Quarter%20volume%20NEB%20Next%20Ultra%20II%20DNA%20Library%20Prep%20Kit%20for%20Illumina.docx). [NEB Instruction Manual for NEBNext](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-05-07/ce23ruu/manualE7805.pdf).

This is part 2 of the protocol: Clean up and PCR enrichment.

This protocol assumes up to 96 input samples and follows the attached experimental protocol.

After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 2), proceed with part 3: Final Clean Up.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: See the attached experimental protocol.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Bead based clean up, wash and elute.
2. Transfer eluate to PCR plate containing master mix.
2. Run PCR cycling steps on the thermocycler module.
