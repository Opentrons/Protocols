This is part 2 of the protocol: Clean up and PCR enrichment.

This protocol assumes up to 96 input samples and follows the attached experimental protocol.

After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 2), proceed with part 3: Final Clean Up.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: See the attached experimental protocol.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Bead based clean up, wash and elute.
2. Transfer eluate to PCR plate containing master mix.
2. Run PCR cycling steps on the thermocycler module.
