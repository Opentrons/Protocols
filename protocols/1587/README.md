## Description
This protocol performs tip cherrypicking from source to target plates as specified in an input CSV file. If specified, the tip is transferred to the next available well in the destination rack, moving down the rack columns before across the rack rows. The number of input racks and fresh empty racks to load are automatically determined through parsing the input CSV file.
