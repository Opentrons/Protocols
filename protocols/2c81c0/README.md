## Description
This protocol performs a custom cherrypicking workflow from `.csv` file using custom filtertips. The `.csv` file should be formatted as follows, **including header line** (all empty lines are ignored):

```
source labware,source slot,source well,volume,destination labware,destination slot,destination well,height offset from top of source well (mm)
plate,1,A2,7,tuberack,5,A4,-4
plate,2,H10,9,tuberack,3,D1,-4
```

Note that `source labware` and `destination labware` must be either `plate`, `tuberack`, or `deepplate`.
