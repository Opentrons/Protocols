## Description
This is part 3 of a 4 part protocol for the rhAmpSeq kit.
* [Part 1](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/onsite-ganda-1)

* [Part 2](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/onsite-ganda-2)
* [Part 4](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/onsite-ganda-4)

This portion adds three components to 30 uL samples as outlined in the rhAmpSeq manual.
* Indexing PCR Primer i5, prepared in 96 well plate with i7 primer
* Indexing PCR Primer i7 prepared in 96 well plate with i5 primer
* 4X rhAmpSeq Library Mix 2

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: How many samples are to be run, from 1 to 96
* `P20 Multi GEN2 mount`: Which side the P20 Multi pipette is attached to
* `Flash on Protocol Completion?`: Will the OT-2 lights flash on and off when the protocol is complete?

### Protocol Steps
1. 5 uL of library mix from slot 2, column 1 is added to all samples in slot 1 on the magnetic module
2. 4 uL of primer mixes from slot 4 is added to all samples in slot 1 on the magnetic module. Each sample receives a unique combination
3. Robot lights flash on and off to signal protocol has completed

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
