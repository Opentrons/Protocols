### Protocol Steps
1. Transfer 16 uL of Master mix from reservoir trough to all wells in 384 well plate (same tips) in
position 8 (PCR 2 Plate). Use tip box in position 3 discard the tips into the waste.
2. Use multidispense 2uL times 4 (take up 8uL and dispense 2 4 times in order to maximize
efficiency) of INDEX from plate in position 7 (INDEX) (a1) to plate in position 8 (PCR 2 plate)
(a1,b1,a2,b2). A2 to (a2,b2,a4,b4) etc (see provided picture for explanation) discard the tips to their
original box after each step.
3. Transfer 2uL of sample from plate in position 9 (PCR 2 pooled plate) to plate in position 8 (PCR 2
plate). A1 to A1, A2 to A2 etc… see picture attached. Discard the tips into their original box location
after every transfer.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
