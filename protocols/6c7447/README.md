**Using the customizations fields, below set up your protocol.**
* **P10 Multi Mount**: Select which mount (left or right) the P10 Multi is attached to.
* **P300 Single Mount**: Select which mount (left or right) the P300 Single is attached to.
* **Pre-Wet Tips?**: Specify whether or not you'd like a mix step prior to each transfer to pre-wet the tip.



**Note**: The tip racks in slot 5 and 6 should be empty, with tips only in row 'A'. This will allow the P10-Multi to effectively operate as a single channel pipette.
