## Description
This protocol automates the first part of a seven part protocol for the [GeneRead QIAact Lung DNA UMI Panel Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/instruments-and-automation/genereader-system/generead-qiaact-lung-panels-ww/) which constructs molecularly bar-coded DNA libraries for digital sequencing. This protocol automates the Fragmentation, End-repair and A-addition part described in the [GeneRead QIAact Lung DNA UMI Panel Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=94ab92d2-1918-4388-989b-4cefa8eed203&lang=en).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: The total number of DNA samples. Samples must range between 1 (minimum) and 12 (maximum).
* `Samples Labware Type`: The starting samples can be placed in either 1.5 mL tubes on the Opentrons Tube Rack OR in a 96 Well Plate.
* `P300 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pre-Cool Thermocycler and Temperature Module to 4°C.
2. Prepare and place reagents on the temperature module.
3. Transfer 4 uL of DNA to PCR Plate on Thermocycler (This is performed for each sample). Change tips for each sample.
4. Thoroughly mix the master mix 10 times with a volume of 50 uL.
5. Transfer 16 uL of Master Mix to each reaction well on PCR plate on Thermocycler. Mix 10 times with a volume of 10 uL. Change tips for each sample.
6. Transfer 5 uL of Fragmentation Enzyme Mix to Thermocycler Reaction Plate. Change tips for each sample.
7. Set Thermocycler Lid temperature to 103°C
8. Begin thermocycler profile: 4°C for 1 minute, 32°C for 24 minutes, 72°C for 30 minutes.
9. Set and hold Thermocycler block temperature at 4°C.
10. Protocol completed!

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
