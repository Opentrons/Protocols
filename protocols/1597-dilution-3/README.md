## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. 9ml of PBS is transferred to the mix tube in tuberack well C1.
7. Using a new tip, 1ml of E. coli reagent is directly transferred to each of the 3 tubes in tuberack wells B2, B3 and B4.
8. Using the same tip from step 7, 1ml of E. coli reagent reagent is transferred to the mix tube in tuberack well C1.
9. The contents of the mix tube are mixed 5x to create a 10x dilution of E. coli reagent in PBS.
10. 500ul of 10x diluted E. coli reagent is transferred from the mix tube to each of the 3 tubes in tuberack wells C2, C3 and C4.
