With this protocol, you can perform high-quality nucleic acid purifications using [Omega Bio-tek Mag-Bind® TotalPure NGS](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/mag-bind-total-pure-ngs) magnetic beads and the [Opentrons Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/magdeck). This setup yields high quality PCR product and other nucleic acids without the use of centrifugation or vacuum separation.

This kit is widely used in NGS cleanup for its affordability and simplicity. It is also well-adapted for nucleic acid size selection by varying bead ratios for  the  isolation  of  a  wide  array  of  fragment  sizes. For more detailed information on how to use this protocol, please see our [Application Note](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/Technical+Notes/Omega_Application_Note.pdf).

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol as follows:

   * **Pipette:** Specify your pipette. We recommend using a p50 or p300 multi- or single-channel.
   * **Pipette Mount:** Specify which mount (left or right) your pipette is on.
   * **Sample number:** Customize the number of samples to run per protocol. A multiple of 8 is recommended when you are using a multichannel pipette.
   * **Sample volume:** Specify the starting volume (in uL) of the input sample.
   * **Bead Ratio:** Customize the ratio of beads for left or right side size-selection of fragments. *The default bead ratio is 1.8x the input sample volume.*
   * **Elution Volume:** Specify the final volume (in uL) to elute the purified nucleic acid. *The Opentrons MagDeck supports elution volumes above 10 µL.*

Make sure to add reagents to your labware before placing it on the deck! You can see where to place your reagents below.
