## Description
This is a simple protocol to illustrate the speaker functionality of the OT-2!

With this protocol, the robot will pick up and drop a tip. Following this simple command, a song will begin to play. Using this as a template, adding a sound to your protocol should be fairly easy.

This protocol allows you to select the pipette, mount, and tip rack you would like to use for this demonstration. The only labware needed will be the tip rack and this should be loaded on deck slot 1.


### Labware
* [Opentrons Tip Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/universal-filter-tips/)


### Pipettes
* [Opentrons Pipette (GEN2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/pipettes/)

### Protocol Steps
1. Pipette will pick up tip.
2. Pipette will drop tip.
3. A sweet sound will flow out of your favorite liquid-handling robot.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
