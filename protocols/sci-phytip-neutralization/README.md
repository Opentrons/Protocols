# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Protein Purification
	* ProPlus PhyTip® Columns


## Description
Since the elution buffer supplied along with PhyTip® Protein A, ProPlus or ProPlus LX Columns is highly acidic (pH 2.5), this protocol (Neutralization) is developed to transfer the neutralization buffer (pH 9.0) to the final product of protein purification (elution plate) to adjust the pH.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pick up a tip (slot 6)
2. Transfer neutralization buffer (slot 10) to each well containing the eluate (slot 11)


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
