## Description
This protocol automates the third part of a seven part protocol for the [GeneRead QIAact Lung DNA UMI Panel Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/instruments-and-automation/genereader-system/generead-qiaact-lung-panels-ww/) which constructs molecularly bar-coded DNA libraries for digital sequencing. This protocol automates the Cleanup of Adapter-ligated DNA with QIAact Beads part described in the [GeneRead QIAact Lung DNA UMI Panel Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=94ab92d2-1918-4388-989b-4cefa8eed203&lang=en).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: The total number of DNA samples. Samples must range between 1 (minimum) and 12 (maximum).
* `P300 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `Magnetic Module Engage Height (mm)`: The height the magnets should raise.

### Reagent Setup

* Thermocycler (Slot 7): PCR Product from Adapter Ligation

* Slot 1: Magnetic Module with NEST 96 Well Deep Well Plate

* Slot 2: 96 Well Aluminum Block with Empty PCR Tubes. For Forward PCR Enrichment Add Tubes in Column 1 and Column 2 (Up to 12 tubes for 12 samples). For Reverse PCR Enrichment Add Tubes in Column 11 and Column 12 (Up to 12 tubes for 12 samples).

* Slot 3: Temperature Module with 24 Well Aluminum Block. Add QIAact Beads in NEST 2.0 mL tube in position A1.

* Slot 5: NEST 12 Well Reservoir: 80% Ethanol (A1, Blue) and Nuclease-Free Water (A12, Pink)
