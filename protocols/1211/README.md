## Description
With this protocol, your robot can perform multiple well-to-well liquid transfers using a single-channel pipette by parsing through a user-defined .csv file.

The .csv file should be formatted as shown in the example below, **including headers**:

```
Source Labware,Source Slot,Source Well,Dest Labware,Dest Slot,Dest Well,Volume
agilent_1_reservoir_290ml,1,A1,nest_96_wellplate_100ul_pcr_full_skirt,4,A11,1
nest_12_reservoir_15ml,2,A1,nest_96_wellplate_2ml_deep,5,A5,3
nest_1_reservoir_195ml,3,A1,nest_96_wellplate_2ml_deep,5,H12,7
```

All available empty slots will be filled with the necessary tipracks, and the user will be prompted to refill the tipracks if all are emptied in the middle of the protocol.
