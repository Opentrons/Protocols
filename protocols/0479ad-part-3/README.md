## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina

## Description
This protocol uses multi-channel P20 and P300 pipettes to perform library prep steps on 8-48 input total RNA samples according to the attached NEB user guide. This is part-3 of a six part process (bead purification of double-stranded cDNA). User-determined parameters are available to specify the number of samples and the magnet engage height and time.

### Protocol Steps
1. Use settings in the OT app to pre-cool the temperature module in slot 1 to 4 degrees C prior to running this protocol.
2. The protocol will alert the user to ensure reagents are present on deck in sufficient volume.
3. The p300 multi will add NEBNext Sample Purification Beads to the double-stranded cDNA samples in the magnetic module plate, mix, and then move half the volume to the corresponding wells in the right side of the plate.
4. The OT-2 will wait 5 minutes for an on-deck incubation.
5. The magnets will engage to pellet the beads. The p300 multi will remove and discard the supernatant.
6. The p300 multi will wash the bead pellets twice with 80 percent ethanol.
7. The OT-2 will wait for the bead pellets to air dry.
8. The magnets will disengage for elution.
9. The p300 multi will add 0.1X TE and mix to resuspend the beads.
10. The magnets will engage to pellet the beads.
11. The p300 multi will recover and recombine (from left and right sides of the plate) the eluates, transferring them to the output plate.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters using the parameters section on this page, then download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
3. Set up your deck and run labware position check using the OT App. For tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
4. Hit 'Run'.
