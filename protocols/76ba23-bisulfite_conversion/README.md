# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
Part 2 of 5: Cell-free DNA (output from step 1) is chemically treated to convert unmethylated cytosine (C to T) in order to reveal patterns of methylated cytosine by DNA sequencing (methylated cytosine is protected and remains unchanged). This bisulfite conversion is followed by bead-clean up, elution, and transfer of the eluate to a fresh PCR plate.

With this protocol, your robot will use reagents from the Zymoresearch EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit [Zymoresearch EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/ez-dna-methylation-gold-kits) to perform the custom steps (DNA extraction, Bisulfite Conversion, PCR1, PCR2, Pooling) detailed in the HKG SOP.[HKG SOP](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-03-04/vw23kchHKG%20Standard%20Operating%20Procedure%20for%20DNA%20extraction%20Targeted%20next%20generation%20sequencing%20and%20.xlsx).

This is part 2 of the protocol: Bisulfite Conversion.

This step performs the bisulfite conversion and bead-clean up steps using the output samples from step 1 (DNA extraction).

After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 2), proceed with part 3: PCR1.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: Place cell free DNA samples (output from DNA Extraction in step 1), CT conversion reagent, beads, water, wash, magnetic module, waste reservoir, elution plate and tips on the OT-2 deck.  

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Distribute cell-free DNA and CT conversion buffer to the PCR plate.
2. Pause for the following steps (OT-2 deck lights will signal pauses):

           Thermocycling steps (outside of the OT-2).

           Replenish tips.

           55 degree incubations (outside of the OT-2) to dry beads and elute.

3. Desulphonation, bead clean up, elute and transfer eluate to fresh PCR plate.
