This protocol allows your robot to distribute a master mix solution from well A1 of a reservoir or deep well plate to a target (a plate or a set of PCR strips on an aluminum block). The robot will then transfer DNA samples to the destination. At this point the samples can be mixed if so desired. The protocol works with both single- and multi-channel pipettes, just be sure that the minimum end of their combined volume range covers the smallest volume. There is also an option to place the DNA template plate, and the target plate on temperature modules. The protocol allows a user to 1) transfer the DNA samples of a 96 well plate to the target 96 well plate or 2) transfer up to four 96 well plates containing template DNA to a 384 well plate.

If only one pipette is selected it can use all 5 tipracks located on slots 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. If two pipettes are loaded 4,7, and 10 are used by the left pipette and 5, and 8 by the right pipette.

Explanation of parameters below:
* `Number of samples` : The number of DNA template samples to mix with PCR mastermix on the target well plate. This parameter controls how many plate columns the mastermix is transferred to as well as how many columns of samples are transferred to the destination plate.
* `Number of mixes`: How many times to mix the DNA template samples with the mastermix after adding them together
* `Aspiration rate multiplier`: A multiplier for controlling the flow rate of aspiration: Less than 1 to slow down, or greater than one to speed up aspiration.
* `Dispensation rate multiplier`: A multiplier for controlling the flow rate of dispensation, less than 1 to slow down, or greater than one to speed up dispensation.
* `Right pipette type`: Pipette in the right mount, it can be either a single channel or a multi-channel pipette
* `Left pipette type`: Pipette in the left mount, it can be either a single channel or a multi-channel pipette.
* `Filtered or unfiltered tips for the left pipette?`: Whether the left pipette is using filter or regular tips. for P20s and P10s the options are Opentrons 20 µL filtered tips, or 20 µL unfiltered.
for P50 and P300s the filtered tips are 200 µL Opentrons filtered tips, and the non-filtered are 300 µL Opentrons regular tips. For the P1000 the options is either Opentrons 1000 µL filtered or non-filtered tips.
* `Filtered or unfiltered tips for the right pipette?`: Whether the right pipette is using filter or regular Opentrons tips
* `Mastermix volume (in µl)`: The volume of mastermix to transfer to each well on the destination plate (in µL)
* `DNA volume (in µl)`: The amount of DNA template to transfer to each destination plate from the DNA template plate (in µL)
* `Mastermix reservoir`: A 1 well, or 12 well reservoir, or a deep well plate containing your PCR mastermix in well `A1` (or the column spanning `A1` to `H1`)
* `PCR well plate (or PCR strips) containing template DNA`: Your source of template DNA, such as a 96 well plate (up to 4 when the destination plate is a 384 well plate)
* `Destination PCR well plate or PCR strips`: This is the well plate where the PCR mastermix and the  DNA template is transferred to and mixed. This can be a 96 well plate, PCR strips on an aluminum block, or a 384 well plate.
* `Temperature module for the 1st DNA template well plate`: (Optional) You can load a temperature module for your (1st) DNA template well plate if you want to control its temperature.
* `Temperature module for the destination well plate`: (Optional) You can load a temperature module for your destination well plate if you want to control its temperature.

### Protocol Steps
1. The protocol distributes mastermix to the destination plate
3. DNA template samples are transferred from the DNA source plates to the destination plate
4. The samples are mixed by pipetting

### Process
1. Input the parameters you wish to control.
2. Select your pipettes.
3. Input the desired master mix and DNA volume in each well.
4. Download your protocol.
5. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
6. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
7. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
8. Hit "Run".
9. Robot will distribute master mix solution from trough to PCR strips in slot 2.
10. Robot will transfer DNA from PCR strips in slot 1 to those in slot 2.
