# 3D Black Bio RNA Extraction

### Author

## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* RNA Extraction


## Description
This protocol automates RNA extraction according to the 3D Black Bio RNA Extraction Kit.</br>
</br>
Using the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette, this protocol can accommodate up to 96 samples per run and can be configured to run any multiple of 8 up to 96. Starting with at least 200µL of sample in a standard 96-well plate, the entire process is automated and ends with 60µL of elution containing RNA dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate. The elution is then ready for RT/qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, hybridization, etc.</br>

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

**Reagent Preparation**</br>
Prepare all reagents according to manual.</br>
</br>
**Proteinase K**: At least 10µL (12µL is recommended) per column of samples should fill a PCR Strip.</br>
The PCR strip should be placed in column 1 of the [Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/aluminum-block-set)</br>
</br>
**MagBeads**: At least 20µL (22µL is recommended) per column of samples should fill 1 (or 2, if processing more than 48 samples) PCR strip(s).</br>
The PCR strip(s) should be placed in column(s) 3 (and 4, if processing more than 48 samples) of the [Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/aluminum-block-set)</br>
</br>
**Lysis-Binding Mix**: In slots 1-6 of the [NEST 12-Well Reservoir](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-12-well-reservoir-15-ml).</br>
For every column (8 samples), 7mL of Lysis-Binding Mix should be added to the reservoir. Each slot of the 12 well reservoir can accommodate volume for 2 columns/16 samples and should be loaded sequentially (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 1 would get 14mL lysis-binding mix, slot 2 would get 7mL lysis-binding mix, slot 3 would be empty, etc).</br>
</br>
**Wash 1**: In slots 7-12 of the [NEST 12-Well Reservoir](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-12-well-reservoir-15-ml).</br>
For every column (8 samples), 6.5mL of wash 1 should be added to the reservoir. Each slot of the 12 well reservoir can accommodate volume for 2 columns/16 samples and should be loaded sequentially (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 7 would get 13mL wash 1, slot 8 would get 6.5mL wash 1, slot 9 would be empty, etc).</br>
</br>
**Wash 2**: In [NEST 1-Well Reservoir](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-1-well-reservoir-195-ml).</br>
For every column (8 samples), 14mL of wash 2 should be added to the reservoir.</br>
</br>
**Elution Buffer**: At least 60µL (65µL is recommended) per column of samples should fill a PCR Strip. Each PCR strip can accommodate up to two columns worth (16) samples.</br>
The PCR strips should be loaded in columns 7-12 of the [Opentrons 96-Well Aluminum Block](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/aluminum-block-set)
