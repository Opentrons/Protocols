# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This is part two of a five part protocol for the [Illumina DNA Prep kit](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/nextera-dna-flex.html)

[Part 1](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/ff5763)

[Part 3](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/ff5763_part3)

[Part 5](https://develop.protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/ff5763_part5)

Part 2: Post-Tagmentation Clean-Up
Tagmentation Stop Buffer (TSB) is added to each sample with a multi-channel 20ul pipette, using a fresh tip each time. The multi-channel 300ul pipette is then used to mix the samples before the plate is tranferred to an off-deck thermocycler. Once the post-tagmentation thermocycler program has completed, the plate is returned to slot 2 and 'Resume' is clicked on the OT-2 application

Samples are subsequently moved to a deep well plate locked onto the magnetic module in slot 4. The magnetic module is engaged and left for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes the supernatant is discarded into the liquid trash in slot 6.

Tagmentation Wash Buffer (TWB) is utilized to wash the samples in the magnetic module twice as follows:
100ul TWB is added to the samples, the magnetic module is engaged for 3 minutes, then supernatant is removed to liquid trash in slot 6.

After the two TWB washes a third TWB wash is partially done. 100ul TWB is added to the samples and the magnetic module is engaged. Part 3 should be initiated as soon as possible after this step.

* `Number of Samples`: Total number of samples from 1 to 48

### Protocol Steps
1. 10ul TSB from slot 1 row 1 is added to samples in slot 2
2. Sample plate is moved to pre-prepared thermocycler
3. Post-thermocycler, samples in slot 2 are transferred to NEST 2ml deep well plate in slot 4 ontop of the magnetic module
4. Magnetic module is engaged for 3 minutes
5. Supernatant is discarded from slot 4 samples to liquid trash in slot 6
6. 100ul TWB is added from slot 5 well 1 to sample plate on magnetic module
7. Magnetic module is engaged for 3 minutes
8. Supernatant is removed from sample plate on magnetic module
9. Steps 6, 7, and 8 are repeated
10. 100ul TWB is added from slot 5 well 1 one final time and left on an engaged magnetic module into part 3

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
