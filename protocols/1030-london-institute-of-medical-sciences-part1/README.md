This protocol allows your robot to perform the Zyppy™-96 Plasmid MagBead Miniprep. The Miniprep is the high-throughput, pellet-free method for *E. coli* plasmid DNA isolation.

The first part of this is Growing 96-Well Bacterial Cultures, where the robot will distribute LB medium and inoculant to a 96-Well Block. User will then need to seal the block using an Air-Permeable Sealing Cover and incubate the cultures for 24 hours at 37°C with constant shaking.

### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Reagents
* [MagDeck](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/magdeck)
* [TempDeck](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/tempdeck)

### Reagent
* [Zyppy™-96 Plasmid MagBead Miniprep](https://www.zymoresearch.com/zyppy)

## Process
1. Input your desired inoculant volume (2-3 uL).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".
7. Robot will dispense 750 uL of LB medium into the each well of the 96-well block in slot 2.
8. Robot will dispense your input volume of inoculant from the 96-well Inoculant block in slot 4 to each well of the block in slot 2.
