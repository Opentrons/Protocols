# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Cherrypicking

## Description

This is a flexible protocol to accommodate .csv file-specified coordinates. You can upload your coordinates for 2 sources and up to 10 locations specified in the .csv template [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/751127/CSV+Template+-+Sheet1.csv), and upload your edited template below at the parameter `Transfer .csv File`. The template has some pre-defined values, but you will likely need to modify these values to suit your specific labware and workflow.

Note that the coordinates are defined in millimeters from the bottom left-most corner of the Opentrons deck slot 1.
