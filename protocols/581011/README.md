## Description
This protocol parses an uploaded .csv file (see below) and determines the number of tips to pick up with a multi-channel pipette. The pipette transfers the specified volume of target cell to a 384 well-plate to the parsed wells by multi-dispensing as much as the pipette tip can accommodate before returning to the reservoir. New tips are awarded between each target cell.

Note: Part 1 and Part 2 should receive the exact same .csv file.

Find part two of the protocol (effector cell loading) below:

[Part 2 - Effector Cell Loading](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/581011-pt2)

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `.CSV File`: Upload the .csv file according to the template shown [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/581011/co-culture_template_protocol.numbers). Any well to the left of a forward slash (`/`) will correspond to the well in the reservoir containing the desired target cell. Any well to the right of a forward slash (`/`) will correspond to the effector cell in the 96 well plate for part 2 of this protocol. If a cell is only to receive one of the effector or target cells, place a `0` (e.g. A1/0 would mean target cell from A1 of the reservoir with no effector cell). All cells that are to be skipped (receive neither effector nor target cell) should have a lowercase `'x'` in the resepective cell in the .csv file.
* `Transfer Volume Effector Cell`: Specify the volume (in ul) to transfer between effector cells in reservoir to well plate.
* `Pre-mix before aspirating in source well plate?`: Specify whether or not to pre-mix before each transfer of target cell in reservoir to plate.
* `Pre-mix height in well plate`: If `Pre-mix` variable is set to `Yes`, specify the height in the reservoir wells in which to pre-mix.
* `Pre-mix repetitions`: If `Pre-mix` variable is set to `Yes`, specify the number of repetitions to mix before each transfer.
* `Pre-mix Volume`: If `Pre-mix` variable is set to `Yes`, specify the pre-mix volume (in ul).
* `Pre-mix Rate`: If `Pre-mix` variable is set to `Yes`, specify the mix rate. A value of `1` is default mix speed, whereas a value of `0.5` is half of the default mix speed, etc.
* `Transfer Aspiration Height`: Specify the height in which to aspirate from in the well plate. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.
* `Transfer Dispense Height`: Specify the height in which to dispense from in the well plate. Default is 1mm from the bottom of the reservoir.
* `Aspiration Rate`: Specify the aspiration rate for transfers. A value of `1` is default aspiration speed, whereas a value of `0.5` is half of the default aspiration speed, etc.
* `Dispense Rate`: Specify the dispense rate for transfers. A value of `1` is default dispense speed, whereas a value of `0.5` is half of the default dispense speed, etc.
* `P300 Multi-Channel Mount`: Specify whether the P300 Multi-Channel pipette is on the left or right mount.

### Protocol Steps
1. Protocol scans .csv file.
2. Protocol determines number of tips to pickup with 8 channel pipette.
3. Target cell is aspirated from reservoir, with pre-mix if selected.
4. Target cell is dispensed into 384 well-plate.
5. Control are added to 384 plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
