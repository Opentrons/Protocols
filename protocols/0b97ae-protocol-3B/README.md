# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS LIBRARY PREP
	* QIASeq FastSelect


## Description
This is Part 3 to the QIAseq FastSelect 5s, 16s, 23s Protocol. This protocol is used to perform the addition of samples with mastermix into a plate.
Part 1 to this protocol is the normalization of samples.
Part 2 to this protocol is the Fragementation.

### Deck Setup
![deck](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/0b97ae/deck.jpg)
Water Reservoir (slot 2):
	Column 1: Nuclease Free Water
	Column 2: Binding Buffer
	Column 3 & 4: Ethanol
	Column 10, 11 & 12: Empty for Supernatent Removal
Diluted RNA Plate (slot 7 Temperature Module):
	RNA Samples Starting Plate
Reagent Plate (Slot 10):
	Column 1: MasterMix
	Column 2: Magentic Beads

### Reagent Setup

### Protocol Steps
1. Before this protocol the RNA plate should have went through the thermocycler according to FastSelect 5s/16s/23s, Table 3 and placed on a back on the temperature deck on slot 7.
2. The Reagent plate will be placed on the temperature module on slot 10, which will contain MasterMix in column 1 and magentic beads in column 2.
3. The reservoir will be placed on slot 2, which will contain Nucleas Free Water in well 1, Binding Buffer in well 2, and Ethanol in wells 3 and 4. Wells 10, 11 and 12 will be used for supernatent removal.



### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
