## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Mass Spec

## Description

This custom protocol performs 2 parts of a mass spec sample prep:
1. Precipitate supernatant transfer
2. Mobile phase A reconstitution

The user is prompted to refill the tuberacks for as many samples as specified. The protocol begins with samples 1-24 loaded in the tuberack on slot 1.
