This protocol automates the NucleoMag® Pathogen kit for flexible magnetic bead based isolation.

Before beginning the protocol on the OT-2, the following preparation steps are needed.
1. Perform the lysis according to the NucleoMag® Pathogen user manual.
2. Fill the 12-Well Buffer Reservoir according to the table below.
3. Resuspend the NucleoMag® B-Beads by vortexing and place them in Position A1 of the 2mL Tube Rack.
4. Load the instrument deck according to the displayed positions.
5. Place the Square-well Block containing the lysates on the Magnetic Module and start the run.
