## Description
This protocol performs a custom PCR preparation by transferring mastermix and sample from 1.5ml snapcap tubes and 8-strip PCR tubes, respectively. Mastermix tubes are actively cooled on a temperature module, and samples are passively cooled on a pre-frozen 96-well aluminum block.

Mastermix tubes should be aligned *down* the aluminum block on the temperature module before moving *over* a column (i.e. A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, etc.)

## Process
1. Input the number of mastermixes to be processed, the number of CDNA samples to be processed, and the mount side for your P20 GEN2 single-channel pipette.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
