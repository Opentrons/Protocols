# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep


## Description
This protocol performs a custom 384-well PCR preparation. The user has the option to enter the following parameters:
* number of samples
* volume of sample
* number of mastermixes
* volume of mastermix
* number of replicates per sample + mastermix combination

Mastermixes should be pre-mixed and loaded into individual tubes as shown below. For efficiency, the mastermixes will first be plated from their source tubes into distribution columns using a single channel pipette, before being loaded into the 384-well plate with an 8-channel pipette.

For sample traceability, an output .csv file will be written to the robot's Jupyter notebook server for each protocol run. The user has the option to input a `run ID` to distinguish each run. To find these output files, please refer to [this support article](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Uploading-files-through-Jupyter-Notebook).

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
