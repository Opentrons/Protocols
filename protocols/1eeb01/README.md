# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol is a custom nucleic acid extraction that begins with the samples in 1.5mL tubes. This protocol utilizes the [Opentrons Magnetic Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck) and the [Opentrons Temperature Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/tempdeck) for this extraction.  
The protocol begins by adding 500µL of Buffer 1 to all tubes that will contain samples on the temperature module. Once complete, 500µL of sample is transferred from 1.5mL tubes in an [Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) to the tubes containing Buffer 1.
After a heating step, DNA and Magnetic Beads are added to the sample tubes on the temperature module and the samples are transferred to a deepwell plate on the magnetic module.
Once on the magnetic module, the magnet is engaged and after the beads settle, the supernatant is removed. Using Buffer 2, three consecutive wash steps occur with the samples on the magnetic module.  
At this point, the user will be prompted to replace the tube(s) in the Tube Rack with Buffer 3 and the Reaction Mix (more info on this below). Buffer 3 will then be added to the beads, mixed with the beads, then transferred back to the temperature module for a 5 minute incubation at 65C.  
Post-incubation, the samples will be moved back to the deepwell plate on the magnetic module, but in a new, clean well. The magnet will engage after all of the samples have been transferred. Following this, the reaction mix will be distributed to all of destinations in PCR strips. The elution will then be transferred to a clean PCR strip, before 5µL gets transferred to two tubes containing the reaction mix.  
This concludes the OT-2 portion of the protocol and the user will be prompted to move the samples to 65c for a 20 minute incubation to complete the protocol.  

Adjust the parameters and download the protocol below.  

*Note*: This protocol is still a work in progress and will likely need further optimizations; please keep this in mind when using this protocol.
