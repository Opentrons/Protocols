This protocol is a translation of the attached json protocol [json protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-04-19/ul63i18/Apostle%20Sample%20Lysis%204.json) to python with a couple additional features for control of the blow out location in order to place it near the bottom of the well: 10 ul sample lysis buffer is distributed from a reservoir to the columns of a 96 deep-well plate with a blow out occurring after each dispense in a location close to the bottom of the well.
The deck layout can be displayed by uploading the attached json protocol to the [Opentrons Protocol Designer web page](https://opentrons.com/protocols/designer/).

## Process
1. Input your number of samples (1-96) and well bottom clearances (in mm) for aspiration and dispense using the parameters on this page.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
