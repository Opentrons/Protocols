# Transfer with Temperature Module

### Author

## Categories
* Basic Pipetting
	* Plate Filling


## Description
This protocol utilizes the P300 (GEN2) and P1000 pipettes to transfer and mix reagents between their original container and destination plate.

The protocol begins by making four (4) dilutions of reagent with heparin or sample. These dilutions are then added to a PCR plate on the temperature module and other reagents are added.

For this protocol, be sure that the pipettes (P300 Single GEN2 and P1000 Single) are attached.

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* P300 Single GEN2 Mount: Specify which mount the P300 is on (left or right).
* P1000 Single Mount: Specify which mount the P1000 is on (left or right.
* Incubation Time (in minutes): Specify how many minutes to have have the robot wait (incubate) after adding each reagent to the samples on the temperature module.
