## Description
This is part 2 of a 4 part protocol for the rhAmpSeq kit. This portion performs a cleanup on the PCR amplification product. A reagent list is below:
* 80% Freshly Prepared Ethanol
* IDTE Buffer
* Agencourt AMPure XP Beads

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: How many samples are to be run, from 1 to 96
* `P20 Multi GEN2 mount`: Which side the P20 Multi pipette is attached to
* `Flash on Protocol Completion?`: Will the OT-2 lights flash on and off when the protocol is complete?

### Protocol Steps
1. 30 uL of Agencourt AMPure XP Beads is added to all samples on the magnetic module in slot 1 and mixed to homogenization
2. Samples with beads are incubated for 10 minutes
3. The magnetic module is engaged for 5 minutes
4. An ethanol wash is performed twice as outlined below:
	* Supernatant is discarded
	* 200 uL of 80% ethyl alcohol is added to samples
	* Samples are incubated for 1 minute
	* Supernatant is discarded
5. Remainder of ethyl alcohol is removed
6. Samples are air dried for 3 minutes
7. Magnetic module is disengaged
8. 15 uL of IDTE, ph 8.0 is added to each sample
9. Samples are incubated for 3 minutes
10. Magnetic module is engaged for 3 minutes
11. 11 uL of the resulting supernatant is removed to the elution plate in slot 5
12. Robot lights flash on and off to signal protocol has completed

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
