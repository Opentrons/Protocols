## Description
This protocol performs a custom protein purification on the OT-2 using the [Promega MagneHis™ Protein Purification System](https://www.promega.co.uk/products/protein-purification/protein-purification-kits/magnehis-protein-purification-system/?catNum=V8550) in conjunction with the [Opentrons magnetic module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/magdeck). The user is prompted to replace tipracks once in the protocol if necessary.

## Process
1. Input the number of samples to process (1-96) and the mount side for your P300 GEN1 multi-channel pipette.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
