## Description
The Illumina COVIDSeq Test is a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing test that is used fo detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This protocol is the sixth part of a seven-part protocol that is run on the OT-2 for this kit.

* Part 1: [Anneal RNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1)
* Part 2: [Synthesize First Strand cDNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-2)
* Part 3: [Amplify cDNA](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-3)
* Part 4: [Tagment PCR Amplicons](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-4)
* Part 5: [Post Tagmentation Clean Up](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-5)
* Part 6: [Amplify Tagmented Amplicons](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-6)
* Part 7: [Pool and Clean Up Libraries](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/04eeb1-part-7)

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `P300 Multichannel GEN2 Pipette Mount`: Choose the mount position of your P300 Multichannel pipette, either left or right.
* `Plate 1 Columns`: Choose which columns master mix should be added on plate 1. Separate column numbers with a comman (Ex: 1,2,3,4).
* `Temperature (C)`: Choose the temperature the temperature module should be set at in the beginning of the protocol.
* `Master Mix Column`: Choose the column on the 12-channel reservoir for the master mix for Plate 1.

### Protocol Steps
1. Engage Magnetic Module.
2. Pick up 200 uL tips from slot 4
3. Aspirate 120 uL from Column 1 (A1) of the Magnetic Plate on Slot 3
4. Dispense into trash and discard tips.

**Steps 2-4 will repeat for the entire plate. This step also included a 10 uL residual volume.**

5. Pick up 200 uL tips from slot 4
6. Aspirate 40 uL of AMP Master Mix
7. Dispense 40 uL of Wash Buffer into Column 1 (A1) of the Magnetic Plate on Slot 3
8. Discard tips into the trash

**Steps 5-8 will repeat for the entire plate.**


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
