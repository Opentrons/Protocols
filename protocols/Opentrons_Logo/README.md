For this demo protocol, you need a clean, empty 96-well plate (where the Opentrons logo will be created) and either a 12-row trough or 1.5mL/2mL tubes in a tube rack to store the water and food dye solution.

The two food dye solutions should be stored in 'A1' and 'A2' of either the 12-row trough or the tube rack.

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* Pipette Model: Select which pipette you will use for this protocol.
* Pipette Mount: Specify which mount your single-channel pipette is on (left or right)
* Destination Plate Type: Select which (destination) plate you will use for this protocol.
* Dye Labware Type: Select which (source) labware you will use for this protocol.


### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)


### Time Estimate
* 2-5 minutes depending on pipette model chosen

### Reagents

## Process
1. Select all desired settings according to the “Setup” section above to customize your protocol run.
2. Download your customized OT-2 protocol using the blue “Download” button, located above the deckmap.
3. Upload your protocol into the Opentrons App and follow the instructions there to set up your deck, calibrate your labware, and proceed to run.
4. Make sure to add reagents to your labware before placing it on the deck! Your food dye solution should be in your labware and your destination plate should be empty.
