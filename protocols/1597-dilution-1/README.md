## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. 9ml of PBS is transferred to the mix tube in tuberack well A1.
7. Using a new tip, 1ml of Coliform and HPC reagent is directly transferred to each of the 3 wells in row A of the 6-well plate.
8. Using the same tip from step 7, 1ml of Coliform and HPC reagent is transferred to the mix tube in tuberack well A1.
9. The contents of the mix tube are mixed 5x to create a 10x dilution of Coliform and HPC reagent in PBS.
10. 500ul of 10x diluted Coliform and HPC reagent is transferred from the mix tube to each of the 3 wells in row B of the 6-well plate.
