```
Plate Position (slot), Well ID, Volume (in µl)
1, A1, 3.0
1, B1, 4.0,
...
```

Empty lines are ignored. You can download a template file [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2020-03-07/b303m2c/Verogen-CP-Example-File.xlsx).

The destination tube for all sources should be in the first well (A1) of the custom tuberacak in slot 9.
