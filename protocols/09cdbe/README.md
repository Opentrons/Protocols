## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Consolidation

## Description
This protocol performs a sample consolidation from `.csv` file. The file should be organized in the following way **including header line**:

```
Plate Position,Source Well ID,Destination Tube ID,Volume,,
1,A1,A1,3.0,,
1,B1,A1,4.0,,
1,C1,B1,5.0,,
1,D1,A1,3.0,,
...
```

Empty lines are ignored. You can download a template file [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2020-03-07/b303m2c/Verogen-CP-Example-File.xlsx).

The destination tube for all sources will be a specified location (A1-D6) of the custom tuberack in slot 9.
