# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Serial Dilution


## Description
This protocol performs a simple serial dilution (factor 10) within each well plate for a specified number of well plates. 100ul of solution is mixed 12 times in each column before 20ul is transferred to the following column, with the mix-transfer iteration repeated up to the specified number of columns. New tips are granted between each well plate.
