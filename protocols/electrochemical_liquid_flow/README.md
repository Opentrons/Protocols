## Process
1. Add chemicalA from tube to a well until 1.5 ml (or 4 ml for large wells)
is inside (Pipette 1).

2. Lower pipette to about 1 mm above ground and create a liquid flow over
well center by pipetting in and out (fast) for 45 seconds
(or an adjustable time) while an electrochemical process is occuring (Pipette 1, same tip).

3. Transfer as much as possible of chemicalA to the next well
(Pipette 1, same tip). We need to test how much we can transfer,
probably about 0.25 ml (0.5 ml) will remain.
After one plate (6 wells) is done, transfer chemicalA to chemical-waste instead.

4. Wash out well 3 times with water from container,
by filling 1 ml (3 ml), mix and transfer away as much as possible
to normal-waste (Pipette 2, same tip)

5. Move to next well, start over at step 1 until one plate (6 wells) is done
(remember that already some chemicalA is inside from step 3,
just add some more from tube so it adds up to 1.5 ml (4 ml) again)

6. After repeating steps 1-5 for the entire plate (6 wells):
Add 1 ml (3 ml) of Saline to each well (Pipette 2, new tip,
same tip for all 6 wells)
