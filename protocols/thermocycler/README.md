# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Getting Started
	* Thermocycler Example


## Description

This is a demo protocol, intended for using the [Opentrons Thermocycler Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/thermocycler-module) as a thermocycler. This protocol does not involve any liquid handling, so no pipettes are required to run this protocol. If you are interested in a custom protocol that uses the thermocycler to your lab's specific needs, you can request one from our Applications Engineering Team, using the [Protocol Request Form](https://opentrons-protocol-dev.paperform.co/).


With this protocol, you can specify the traditional thermocycler parameters (denaturation temperature/time, annealation temperature/time, elongation temperature/time).


Additionally, you can specify the lid temperature, sample volume per well, an initialization temperature/time, a final elongation temperature/time, and a final hold temperature that will stay set until you're ready to move the samples.


For more information about the [Opentrons Thermocycler Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/thermocycler-module), please see the [Thermocycler Module white paper](https://opentrons.com/publications/Opentrons-Thermocycler-Module-White-Paper.pdf) or our [Thermocycler Module support article](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3469797-thermocycler-module).

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

The Thermocycler Module should be loaded into its default position in slots 7 and 10 (with some overhang in slots 8 and 11).


Before running the protocol with samples, use the button on top of the Thermocycler to open the lid (if closed) and place your sample plate into the Thermocycler. If needed, place an [Opentrons Thermocycler Seal](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/thermocycler-seals) on the lid. You do not need to close the lid before running the protocol.


**Using the customizations fields, below set up your thermocycler protocol.**
* Sample Volume per Well: Specify how much volume will be in each well for greater accuracy
* Lid Temperature: Specify temperature of lid. We recommend a higher temperature to prevent condensation.

*Initialization*
* Initialization Temperature: Specify the temperature during the initialization phase (will not be cycled)
* Initializatin Time: Specify the time during the initialization phase (will not be cycled)

*Thermocycling*
* Denaturation Temperature: Specify the temperature during the denaturation phase (will be cycled)
* Denaturation Time: Specify the time during the denaturation phase (will be cycled)
* Annealation Temperature: Specify the temperature during the annealation phase (will be cycled)
* Annealation Time: Specify the time during the annealtion phase (will be cycled)
* Elongation Temperature: Specify the temperature during the elongation phase (will be cycled)
* Elongation Time: Specify the time during the elongation phase (will be cycled)
* Number of Cycles: Specify how many cycles to run the Denaturation-Annealation-Elongation loop

*Final Elongation and Hold*
* Final Elongation Temperature: Specify the temperature during the final elongation phase (will not be cycled)
* Final Elongation Time: Specify the time during the final elongation phase (will not be cycled)
* Final Hold Temperature: Specify the final temperature the thermocycler will hold indefinitely.


### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process

1. Specify all desired settings according to the “Setup” section above to customize your protocol run.
2. Download your customized OT-2 protocol using the blue “Download” button, located above the deckmap.
3. If using samples, manually insert your sample plate into the Thermocycler on the OT-2 deck
4. Upload your protocol into the Opentrons App and proceed to run.

### Additional Notes

If you’d like to request a protocol supporting multiple destination plates or require other changes to this script, please fill out our [Protocol Request Form](https://opentrons-protocol-dev.paperform.co/). You can also modify the Python file directly by following our [API Documentation](https://docs.opentrons.com/OpentronsPythonAPIV2.pdf). If you’d like to chat with an automation engineer about changes, please contact us at [protocols@opentrons.com](mailto:protocols@opentrons.com).
