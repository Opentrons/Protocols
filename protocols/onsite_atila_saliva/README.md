## Description
* This protocol preps a 96 well plate with sample and mastermix for PCR. See below for details on reagent setup, protocol steps, etc. Tube racks should be placed in order of the slot numbers on the deck, (1, 2, 3,...,7). The pipette will access each tube rack in this order beginning from tube rack 1 on slot 1. The pipettes will access each tuberack by column (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2...), meaning a 94 sample run would have all tube racks in slots 1-6 filled, with 4 tubes in A1, B1, C1, A2 of slot 7.

* If running a full plate (94 samples), the protocol will use the multi-channel pipette to dispense mastermix to all 96 wells. If running less than 94 samples, say 12 for example, the protocol will use the multi-channel to dispense mastermix into the first column, then the single channel to dispense the first four wells of column 2, then finally mastermix into G12, H12. Note, in this example, that the pipette will be taking mastermix from whichever column it is taking from (1 or 2, dependent on the number of samples running), in which case extra mastermix should be provided for the first four wells of column 1.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples (1-94)`: Specify the number of samples for this run (1-94).
* `Reaction plate`: Specify whether using the non-skirted or half-skirted reaction plate on slot 9. Slot 8 should always use a non-skirted plate. 
* `P20/P300 Pipette Mounts`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host each pipette.

### Deck Setup

### Reagent Setup
* If running more than 6 columns (40 samples), mastermix should be dispensed evenly between columns 1 and 2 of the mastermix plate on slot 8. If running less than 40 samples, mastermix should only be in column one of the mastermix plate.
* Controls should always be in G12 and H12 of the mastermix plate on slot 8.

### Protocol Steps
1. Mastermix is added to the reaction plate up to the number of samples specified.
2. Samples are added to the mastermix wells from the tuberack(s).
3. Controls are added to G12 and H12 of the reaction plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
