## Description
This protocol (Plate Prep 2) performs pipetting to transfer elution buffer from 15 mL conical tubes to a 96 well deepwell plate (the reagent plate) on the OT2. This reagent plate is used for Dynabeads for IP Reagent-In-Plate protocol Part 2. The user can determine the number of samples to be processed.

### Pipettes
* [P300 Single-Channel GEN2](https://opentrons.com/pipettes/)

### Reagents
* [2x Laemmli Sample Buffer](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/sku/1610737-2x-laemmli-sample-buffer?ID=1610737) with reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (BME)

### Deck Setup
* Slot 4 – 96 well deepwell plate (reagent plate)
* Slot 5 - Tube rack/reagent in 15 mL conical tube (reagent stock)

* Purple – elution buffer

### Protocol Steps
1. Elution buffer (reagent stock in 15 mL tubes, slot 5) is transferred to the reagent plate (96 well deepwell plate A12-H12, slot 4) by the single channel pipet.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters (the number of samples to be processed).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the OT App.
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tipracks, and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support articles.
6. Hit "Run".
