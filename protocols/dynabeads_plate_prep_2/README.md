## Description
This protocol (Plate Prep 2) performs pipetting to transfer elution buffer
from 15 mL conical tubes to a 96 well deepwell plate (the reagent plate) on
the OT2. This reagent plate is used for Dynabeads for IP Reagent-In-Plate
protocol Part 2.
The user can determine the number of samples to be processed.

### Protocol Steps
1. Elution buffer (reagent stock in 15 mL tubes, slot 5) is transferred to the reagent plate (96 well deepwell plate A12-H12, slot 4) by the single channel pipet.

### Process

* Input your protocol parameters (the number of samples to be processed).
* Download your protocol.
* Upload your protocol into the OT App.
* Set up your deck according to the deck map.
* Calibrate your labware, tipracks, and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our support articles.
* Hit "Run".
