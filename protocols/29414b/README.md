## Description
This protocol is designed for testing calibration of the OT-2 with a custom tube holder, holding 500µL tubes from Simport Scientific, and non-standard tips. This protocol can be used for testing the **P300 Single Channel Pipette** or the **P300 Multi Channel Pipette**.

If testing the P300 Single Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5µL from A1 to A2, A3, and A4 with a 2-20µL tip. The robot will then make transfers with 20-200µL tips, first 50µL from B1 to B2, B3, and B4; then 200µL from C1, to C2, C3, and C4.

If testing the P300 Multi Channel Pipette, the robot will transfer 5µL from column 1 to column 2, 3, and 4 with 2-20µL tips. The robot will then make transfers with 20-200µL tips, first 50µL from column 5 to column 6, 7, and 8; then 200µL from column 9 to column 10, 11, and 12.
