With this protocol, your robot can perform a modified Quarter Volume NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina protocol described by the [Experimental Protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-05-07/ia13rz0/Quarter%20volume%20NEB%20Next%20Ultra%20II%20DNA%20Library%20Prep%20Kit%20for%20Illumina.docx). [NEB Instruction Manual for NEBNext](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-05-07/ce23ruu/manualE7805.pdf).

This is part 1 of the protocol: End prep and adapter ligation.

This protocol assumes up to 96 input samples and follows the attached experimental protocol.

After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 1), proceed with part 2: Clean Up and PCR Enrichment.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: See the attached experimental protocol.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Combine end prep reagents with the initial DNA samples.
2. Run the end prep protocol on the thermocycler.
3. Do the same for the adapter ligation and then USER enzyme treatment.
