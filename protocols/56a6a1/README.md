## Description
This protocol performs a protein array on ONCYTE SuperNOVA slides mounted on an Inheco Teleshake 1536 using a P300 multi-channel pipette. For reagent setup in the 12-channel reservoir, see 'Additional Notes' below. Note that the user is prompted three times to engage and disengage the shaker (mounted on the deck). The Teleshake with slides will occupy slots 1, 2, 4, and 5, and will be calibrated from slot 4.

## Process
1. Input the mount for your P300 multi-channel pipette, the number of slides to process (1-4), and the manner of sample addition (manual or automatic).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration). **Ensure that you calibrate your slides mounted on the Teleshake to the precise location from which you would like to aspirate liquid.**
6. Hit 'Run'.

### Additional Notes
Reagent setup in 12-channel reservoir:
* Super G blocking buffer: channel 1
* Secondary antibody: channel 2
* PBST: channels 3-4
