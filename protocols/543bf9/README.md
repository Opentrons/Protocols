**CSV File Information**

The protocol will require a CSV file to be uploaded in order to properly function. Please use the following [Serial Dilutions Excel Spreadsheet Template (.XLSX Format)](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/543bf9/serial_dilutions_template.xlsx) to update your values. Once the values are updated click `Save As` and then save it in `.CSV` format. You can then upload that CSV to the protocol for your run.

**Protocol Steps**

1. Transfer 44.5 uL of Diluent into Int1 (Well A1).
2. Transfer 5.5 uL from Stock1 into Int1
3. Mix Int1 3 times, perform blow out, touch tip, then discard tip.

**Note**: This process will repeat as it iterates through the rows in the CSV and add diluent first, then the sample from the previous well or specified well.
