## Description
With this protocol, your robot can perform protein-based compound screening assay by (1) performing serial dilutions of compounds in 384-well plate, (2) adding buffer to diluted compounds, (3) transferring compound + buffer mixture in duplicate in a new plate, (4) adding proteins to each well, and (5) adding substrate to each well.

* P10 Multi-channel Pipette
* p50 Multi-channel Pipette
* [12-row Trough](https://www.usascientific.com/12-channel-automation-reservoir.aspx)
* [Corning 384-well Microplates](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/cls3575?lang=en&region=US)
* [Opentrons 300 uL Tip Racks](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips)
* 10 uL Tip Racks

### Modules

### Reagents

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. Process of the protocol is described in this [PDF](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/1416-quentis-therapeutics/protein-based_compound_screening_process.pdf).
