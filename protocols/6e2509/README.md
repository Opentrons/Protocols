# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
This protocol automates the transfer of PCR mix and samples from up to four 96-well elution plates to a 384-well plate. It follows a specific format detailed in the image below. Columns from the 96 well elution plates correspond to specific wells on the 384 well plate. Each elution plate contains a control that is also transferred into the 384-well plate. For runs that have less than four plates, the controls will need to be added manually for the corresponding elution plate.

For this protocol, be sure that the P20 pipette is attached.

Using the customization fields below, set up your protocol.
* P20 Multichannel Mount: Choose the mount position of your P20 multichannel pipette.
* Number of samples: Input the total number of samples in all four plates. Supports up to 384 samples.
* PCR Mix Transfer Volume: Input the volume of PCR mix to transfer per well. Default is 7.5 uL.
* Sample Transfer Volume: Input the volume of sample to transfer per well. Default is 5 uL.
* Sample Aspiration Height Above Bottom of the Well: Specify the height from the bottom of the well in which the pipette will aspirate.
* Sample Dispensing Height Above Bottom of the Well: Specify the height from the bottom of the well in which the pipette will dispense.
* Master Mix Aspiration Height Above Bottom of the Well: Specify the height from the bottom of the well in which the pipette will aspirate.
* Master Mix Dispensing Height Above Bottom of the Well: Specify the height from the bottom of the well in which the pipette will dispense.


**Note About Reagents:**
PCR Mix should be placed into column A1 of the 96 well plate.
