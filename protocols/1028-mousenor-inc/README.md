## Description
With this protocol, you robot can perform the cAMP-Screen Direct assay using the cAMP-Screen™ Cyclic AMP Immunoassay System from ThermoFisher. The cAMP-Screen assay systems are used for quantification of cellular cAMP for functional assays of receptor activation.

To begin the assay, the robot will prepare 7 serial 1:10 dilutions (0.006 - 6,000 pmol cAMP per 60 uL) in Assay/Lysis buffer in column 1 of a 96-deep well plate. Standard dilutions are transferred to first two empty columns in a 96-well assay plate. 60 uL of samples are transferred from sample plate to the assay plate. The robot will then transfer 30 uL/well of diluted cAMP-AP to all of the used columns. 60 uL/well of anti-cAMP Antibody is added and mixed in each well. After an hour of incubation, the plate is washed 6 times with wash buffer. 100 uL/well of CSPD®/Sapphire-II™ RTU substrate/enhancer solution is then added to the entire plate.

## Process
1. Set the starting column of samples in your source plate.
2. Set the number of columns on the plate that contain your samples.
3. Set the starting column on the assay plate to which you would like the samples be transferred.
4. Download your protocol.
5. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
6. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
7. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
8. Hit "Run".
