## Description

This protocol performs a custom aliquoting procedure based on a randomly-generated 1-4 plate map. Enough volume to accommodate all 4 destination wells, including overage volume, is aspirated from the source well and distributed to all 4 destination wells. A new tip is obtained for each source-destination set. The layout is shown below:

The proper pipette (P20 or P300) is selected automatically based on the input siRNA volume.
