## Description
This protocol automates the QIAseq Targeted RNAscan Panel for Illumina Instruments protocol in the [QIAseq Targeted RNAscan Panel](https://www.qiagen.com/pt/products/discovery-and-translational-research/next-generation-sequencing/rna-sequencing/rna-fusions/qiaseq-targeted-rnascan-panel/?clear=true#orderinginformation) on the OT-2. The QIAseq Targeted RNAscan Panels are a complete Sample to Insight solution that applies the molecular barcode-based digital RNA sequencing strategy to quantify known and new fusion genes.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: The total number of DNA samples. Samples must range between 1 (minimum) and 12 (maximum).
* `Samples Labware Type`: The starting samples can be placed in either 1.5 mL tubes on the Opentrons Tube Rack OR in a 96 Well Plate.
* `P300 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `IL-N7 Adapter Row`: Choose the row the adapters will be used from either Plates A, B, C, or D.
* `Magnetic Module Engage Height`: The height the magnets will raise on the magnetic module.
* `Wash 1 Bead Volume`: Choose the bead volume based on RNA quality.
* `Wash 2 Bead Volume`: Choose the bead volume based on RNA quality (This value is used for all subsequent bead washes).
