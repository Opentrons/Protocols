## Description
This protocol performs a custom sample normalization from a source PCR plate to a second PCR plate, diluting with water from a reservoir. Sample and diluent volumes are specified via .csv file in the following format, including the header line (empty lines ignored):

```
source plate well,destination plate well,volume sample (µl),volume diluent (µl)
A1, A1, 2, 28
```

You can download an example .csv to edit directly [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/ml-normalization/example_csv.csv).
