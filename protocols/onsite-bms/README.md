# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
This protocol transfers sample and diluent to a custom 40 tube rack on the temperature module. Liquid height is tracked in the diluent tube rack, and the temperature module is set to 4C. A fresh tip is granted for each diluent and sample transfer, and mixed after sample is dispensed.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `input .csv file`: Here, you should upload a .csv file formatted in the following way, being sure to include the header line:
```
Diluent Transfer Volume (ul), Dispense Tube (rack), Source Well, Sample Transfer Volume
1000, A1, A1, 20
```
* `Track tips?`: Specify whether to start at A1 of both tip racks, or to start picking up from where the last protocol left off. 
* `Initial Volume Diluent (mL)`: Specify the initial volume of diluent in A1 of the 6 tube rack.
* `P20/P1000 Mounts`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P20 and P1000 pipettes.

### Protocol Steps
1. Diluent is added to the final tube rack in slot 1 per the csv input. Change tips to account for low viscosity.
2. Sample is added to the final tube rack in slot 1 per the csv input. Change tips to avoid cross contamination.
3. Sample and diluent is mixed after dispensing sample.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
