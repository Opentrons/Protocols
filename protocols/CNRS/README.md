## Description
This protocol allows the robot to place 2 drops of liquid 2 cm away from each other in petri dishes.

Steps:
1. Bacterial culture 1 in a 15 mL Falcon tubes (slot 5, well A1) is mixed 5 times with volume of 1000 uL using a P1000.
2. A 40 uL drop of bacterial culture 1 is placed at 1 cm from a petri dish 1 center.
3. Step 1 is repeated for bacterial culture 2 (slot 5, well B1).
4. A 40 uL drop of bacterial culture 2 is placed at 1 cm from a petri dish 1 center, opposite from the previosu drop.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for every petri dish.
