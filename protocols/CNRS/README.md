## Categories
* Basic Pipetting

## Description
This protocol allows the robot to perform agar plate culture by precisely placing 2 drops of liquid 2 cm away from each other in petri dishes. Petri dishes used in the protocol are of 6 cm and 10 cm in diameter. Custom adapters are needed for the petri dishes in order to fit them on the robot deck.

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your pipettes, labware and tiprack using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. Bacterial culture 1 in a 15 mL Falcon tubes (slot 5, well A1) is mixed 5 times with volume of 1000 uL using a P1000.
7. A 40 uL drop of bacterial culture 1 is placed at 1 cm from a petri dish 1 center.
8. Step 1 is repeated for bacterial culture 2 (slot 5, well B1).
9. A 40 uL drop of bacterial culture 2 is placed at 1 cm from a petri dish 1 center, opposite from the previous drop.
10. Repeat steps 1-4 for every petri dish.
