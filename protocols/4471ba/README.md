# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling


## Description
This protocol automates filling plates that have been turned 90-degrees on the deck. Using custom adapters, the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette is used to transfer a set volume (selected below) from a Beckman Coulter 8-Channel Reservoir to a Simport 96-Well Plate (on an adapter that allows the plate to be turned 90-degrees). The P300 Multi-Channel pipette picks up tips from an Opentrons Tip Rack (also on an adapter), by picking up 8/12 tips from the column (liquid transfer happens to 8/12 wells in column on plates) and then the last 4 tips in the column (for last 4/12 wells in columns on plates).
