* [Part 2](./2ed4de-2)

This is a protocol for the Flu Ribogreen Assay protocol. Samples are aligned in the sample tuberack (slot 1) in the following order:
* A1 -> sample 1
* B1 -> sample 2
* C1 -> sample 3
* D1 -> sample 4
* A2 -> sample 5
* B2 -> sample 6
* C2 -> sample 7
* D2 -> sample 8

This example starting deck state shows the layout for 8 samples:  
![deck](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/2ed4de/deck4.png)

* green on sample tuberack: samples
* blue on reagent reservoir: working standard 1
* pink on reagent reservoir: assay buffer 1 (TE)
* purple on reagent reservoir: working standard 2
* orange on reagent reservoir: assay buffer 2 (TR)

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
