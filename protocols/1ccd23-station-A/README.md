## Description
This protocol plates samples from custom or standard tuberacks to a NEST 96-deepwell plate. 10µl proteinase K and 10µl internal control are then added to each sample. Samples are transferred to the plate first down each column, then across each row (A1, B1, C1, ...H1, A2, B2, C2, etc.)
