# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Compound Plating


## Description
This protocol performs a custom compound plating protocol as specified by a user-input .csv file. You can download an example .csv template [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/056543/ex.csv)!

The same tip is used for each source, and the user is prompted to refill the deck state if all destination plates have been processed.
