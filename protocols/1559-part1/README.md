## Description
Links:
* [Part 1: Purify and Fragment mRNA, First & Second Strand cDNA Synthesis, and End Repairs](./1559-part1)
* [Part 2: Adenylate 3' Ends, Ligate Adapters, PCR Amplification](./1559-part2)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit as described in the [Illumina TruSeq® RNA Sample Preparation v2 Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseqrna/truseq-rna-sample-prep-v2-guide-15026495-f.pdf).

This is part 1 of the protocol, which includes (1) Purify and Fragment mRNA, (2) First Strand cDNA Synthesis, (3) Second Strand cDNA Synthesis, and (4) End Repairs. See Additional Notes for more information on robot setup.

After these four steps carried out in this protocol, you can safely stop work and return to it at a later point. If you are stopping, seal the plate with an adhesive seal and store at -25°C to -15°C for up to 7 days.
