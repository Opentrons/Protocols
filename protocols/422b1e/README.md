# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Titration
	* Custom Titration


## Description
This titration protocol utilizes a custom labware definition (beaker + stir plate) for use on the OT-2.</br>
The P1000 Pipette (attached to the right mount) will pick up a tip from the tip rack located in slot 11. For each tube in the Opentrons Tube Rack (located in slot 9), the pipette will transfer 2mL to the beaker in slot 4, wait a predetermined amount of time, then transfer 2mL from the beaker in slot 4 to the beaker in slot 8.

## Process

1. Download your protocol package containing the custom labware definition for the beaker.
2. Upload the labware definition in the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app). For help, please see [this article](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3136506-using-labware-in-your-protocols).
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
