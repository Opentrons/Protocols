## Description
This titration protocol utilizes a custom labware definition (beaker + stir plate) for use on the OT-2.</br>
The P1000 Pipette (attached to the right mount) will pick up a tip from the tip rack located in slot 11. For each tube in the Opentrons Tube Rack (located in slot 9), the pipette will transfer 2mL to the beaker in slot 4, wait a predetermined amount of time, then transfer 2mL from the beaker in slot 4 to the beaker in slot 8.
