## Description
With this protocol, your robot can perform qPCR prep with up to 20 samples on a 96-well plate. See Additional Notes for more information about the setup.

### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Modules
* [Temperature Module](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/hardware-modules/products/tempdeck)

## Process
1. Input your number of samples.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
6. Hit "Run".
7. Robot will transfer 198 uL of PCR Dilution Buffer to a clean 96-well dilution plate.
8. Robot will transfer 2 uL of sample to the 96-well dilution plate.
9. Robot will aliquot 40 uL of DNase I solution to each well of a clean 96-well on the Temperature Module.
10. Robot will transfer the diluted samples from step 8 to each well of the microplate.
11. Robot will set the Temperature Module to 37째 and incubate the plate for an hour.
12. Robot will add 50 uL of ProK mix to each well.
13. Robot will set the Temperature Module to 37째 and incubate the plate for an hour.
14. Robot will increase the temperature of the module to 95째 for 10 minutes.
15. Robot will drop the temperature of the module to 4째.
16. Robot will aliquot 245 uL of TE Buffer to the dilution plate, starting at well A4.
17. Robot will add 5 uL of sample to same well as step 16.
18. Robot will aliquot 7.5 uL of master mix to a new 96-well plate.
19. Robot will transfer 2.5 uL of standards in triplicate from A to G in columns 1-3.
20. Robot will transfer 2.5 uL the negative control in row H1-3.
21. Robot will transfer 2.5 uL of samples in triplicate from top down, left to right, starting in well A4.

### Additional Notes
* Trough Setup
    * Dilution Buffer: **A1**
    * TE Buffer: **A2**
* Tuberack setup
    * DNase I: **A1**
    * ProK Mix: **B1**
    * Master Mix: **C1**
* Your standards (A1-G1) and negative control (H1) should be in column 1 of the PCR strip in slot 5.
