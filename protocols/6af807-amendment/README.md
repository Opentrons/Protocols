	* PCR Prep

## Description
This protocol preps a 384 well plate for up to 8 cDNA samples in triplicates. The protocol can be broken down into 2 main parts:

* cDNA is added in triplicates down the column onto the plate.
* Mastermix is added to the cDNA

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of cDNA`: Specify the number of cDNA tubes that will be loaded onto the tube rack.
* `Number of mastermix tubes`: Specify the number of mastermix tubes that will be added to the cDNA.
* `cDNA/mastermix volume`: Specify the volume of both the cDNA and mastermix. Note, the mastermix volume will be calculated from this volume (total 20ul).
* `P20 Mount`: Specify the mount (left or right) for the P20 single channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. cDNA is transferred in triplicates down a column up to the number of columns as specified in number of mastermixes.
2. Mastermixes are added to each column up to each populated row.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
