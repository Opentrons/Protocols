## Description

With this 9 part workflow, the OT-2 will follow [ArcBio Continuous RNA Workflow - Pre-PCR Instrument and Post-PCR Instrument experimental protocol](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/43d313/ArcBio_RNA_Workflow_020922.xlsx) to convert up to 96 input RNA samples into cDNA libraries. This is Part 5 of 9: This OT-2 protocol uses the RNA Continuous Workflow, Post-PCR Instrument section of attached experimental protocol to perform post-indexing workflow steps.

## Protocol Steps

This is part 5 of 9 parts: Post Indexing. After the steps carried out in this protocol (part 5), proceed to run the Post Indexing Purification protocol (Continuous RNA Workflow - Post-PCR Instrument: Part 6 - RNA-POST-PCR-2 Post Indexing Purification).

Set up: If using a custom labware on the magnetic module, a user-determined engage height must be provided as a parameter value (see protocol parameters below). In advance, prior to running the protocol, place temperature module in deck slot 3 and use settings in the OT App to pre-cool to 4 degrees C. Place Twin Tec 200 uL PCR plate with samples on the Magnetic Module in deck slot 1. Reservoir nest_12_reservoir_15ml in deck slot 5 (A1 - 9.6 mL beads, A12 - Tris). Reagents in strip tubes on 96-well aluminum block opentrons_96_aluminumblock_generic_pcr_strip_200ul (column 1 - depletion mastermix) in deck slot 2. Reservoirs nest_1_reservoir_195ml in deck slots 4 and 6 (slot 6 - 144 mL 80 percent ethanol, slot 4 - waste). Place Opentrons 20 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_20ul in deck slots 10, 11 and Opentrons 200 uL filter tips opentrons_96_filtertiprack_200ul in deck slots 7, 8 and Opentrons 300 uL unfiltered tips opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul in deck slot 9.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps using the p20 multi- and p300 multi-channel pipettes, temperature module and magnetic module:
1. Mix beads with input samples, engage magnets, remove supernatant.
2. Wash the beads twice with 80 percent ethanol.
3. Elute with Tris and combine with depletion master mix. Proceed to off-deck thermocycler steps.

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Use the protocol parameters on this page to make any needed adjustments to the number of samples, well bottom clearances, engage height and time for the deep well plate on the magnetic module, the magnitude of the move used to target and avoid the bead pellet, number of minutes for bead drying.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
5. Hit "Run".
