# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Normalization

## Description
With this flexible protocol, you can normalize the concentrations of up to 32 samples. Just upload your properly formatted .json files (keep scrolling for an example), customize your parameters, and download your ready-to-run protocol.

### Protocol Steps
1. Diluent volume is calculated and added to all wells in deepwell plate if a 2-step dilution is necessary (maximum working volume of 1600µl). The protocol dynamically calculates the maximum efficiency for P300 multi-channel and P1000 single-channel use.
2. The protocol pauses and prompts the user to add the first column of samples (in a user-specified volume) to dilution plate 1.
3. The P300 multi-channel pipette mixes the column both at the bottom of each well and halfway up the liquid for homogeneity. The liquid level is automatically calculated to ensure the pipette tip stays submerged.
4. If necessary, the diluted sample is transferred to the corresponding column in dilution plate 3 that contains pre-added diluent (step 1) for a final dilution.

## Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
