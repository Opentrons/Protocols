# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Normalization


## Description
This protocol performs a custom normalization and LDS addition across 3 sets of 1.5ml tuberacks using P300 and P1000 single-channel pipettes. The normalization volumes are automatically calculated.

The input .csv file specifying the biomasses of all sample input should be formatted as follows ***including first row for column names and first column for row names***. Note that wells that should be ignored should contain a `0` value:

```
,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
A,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
C,80,60.72,82.79,207.23,370.24,265.78,270.34,342.88
D,70,56.65,99.74,249.64,340.56,285.08,294,366.09
E,117.17,162.28,88.7,135.69,322.46,321,285.73,375.51
F,130.01,172.35,93.48,136.36,326.26,285.79,316.29,344.37
```
