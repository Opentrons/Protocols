This protocol plates lysis/binding buffer, samples, and elution buffer in a NEST 96-deepwell plate. Samples should be arranged in up to 4x Opentrons tuberacks, and buffers should be loaded in a NEST 12-channel reservoir. The transfer order is as shown below:

Deepwells A1 and B1 are left empty for controls to be added later on.
