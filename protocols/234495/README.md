# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
     * Mass Spec

## Description
Prepare Standard Samples for Calibration Curves. Prepare Pooled and or Patient Samples.

With this protocol, your robot can perform sample preparation for LC-MS as described [experimental protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-05-12/eq03qff/Protocol-90%20ul-tube.pdf)

This step prepares standards for calibration curves followed by patient samples.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: See details in pause comment at the top of the script and displayed in the OT-app at the start of the protocol.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Make a 1:2 dilution series of unlabeled standards.
2. Prepare a solution of labeled standards.
3. Distribute Golden Plasma to sample tubes.
4. Combine unlabelled standard, NEM, labeled standard.
5. Add TFA in Acetonitrile.
6. Pause for centrifugation.
7. Transfer supernatant to Amicon filters.
8. Pause for centrifugation and drying.
9. Resuspend in Acetonitrile:Water.
