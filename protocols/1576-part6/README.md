This protocol performs the workflow of Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment as described in the [NONACUS Cell3™ Target Protocol Guide v1.2.2](https://nonacus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell3Target_Protocol_v1.2.2.pdf). This particular section is part 6 of the series, which hybridizes the library pool with DNA biotin-labelled probes, to enrich for the targeted region of interest.

Before you start, review the protocol guide to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables. Follow the instructions to set up the appropriate thermocycler program. See 'Additional Notes' below for reagent setup.

After the protocol completes, place the Bio-rad Hardshell plate in the pre-heated thermocycler (95°C) and skip to the next step in the program. Leave the hybridization reaction mix at 65°C on the thermocycler to incubate for 4 hours.
