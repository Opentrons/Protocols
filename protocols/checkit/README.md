## Description

This protocol performs [Next Advance Checkit Go](https://www.nextadvance.com/checkit-go/) volume accuracy testing for Opentrons electronic pipettes on the OT-2. The user can select which model Checkit Go cartridge with which to test their pipette accuracy (2, 5, 10, 20, or 50ul).

This protocol is meant to be used with the following Opentrons pipettes:  
* P20 Single-Channel
* P20 8-Channel
* P300 Single-Channel
* P300 8-Channel

Checkit Go devices are shipped with a red dye to use for testing, but you may also want to use their [red dye pellets](https://www.nextadvance.com/product/checkit-go-dye-pellet-6-pack/). Keep in mind, the protocol you find here is only tested with the Next Advance dye that is provided with the plates. If you plan to use the device with any other liquids, optimizations to the protocol will need to be made. Please contact Next advance support for questions about which liquids can be used on their devices. Contact Opentrons support with questions about the protocol.

### Protocol Steps
For 8-channel pipettes:  
1. The pipette picks up tips and aspirates the Checkit Go-specific volume from the cartridge reservoir.
2. The pipette dispenses the entire liquid volume into the wells of the cartridge and drops the tip. If the
3. The user is prompted to flip the cartridge and record the measurements.

For single-channel pipettes:  

1. The pipette picks up tips and aspirates the Checkit Go-specific volume from the cartridge reservoir.
2. The pipette dispenses the entire liquid volume into the wells of the cartridge, starting in the first well and drops the tip.
3. The user is prompted to flip the cartridge and record the measurements.
4. Steps 1-3 are repeated a total of 8 times for all wells in the plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
