## Description
![Normalization Example](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/normalization/normalization_example.png)

This protocol performs the normalization of samples by adjusting the concentration in Micronic 96 rack. Once normalized it will transfer nuclease-free water to the corresponding wells in a PCR plate and then transfer samples to the corresponding wells in the PCR plate.

**CSV Format**

Your file must be saved as a comma separated value (.csv) file type. Your CSV must contain values corresponding to volumes in microliters (μL). Below is an example of the format for the CSV.


```
Plate position,ng/ul,Volume,ng TOT,ul Final Dil,ul Water
A1,19.9,15,298.7,19.9,4.9
B1,22.4,15,335.5,22.4,7.4
C1,22.2,15,332.9,22.2,7.2
```

## Process

1. Create your CSV file based on the format provided.
2. Upload your CSV, choose your pipette mount positions and enter the final concentration for normalization.
3. Download your customized OT-2 protocol using the blue “Download” button, located above the deckmap.
4. Upload your protocol into the Opentrons App and follow the instructions there to set up your deck, calibrate your labware, and proceed to run.
