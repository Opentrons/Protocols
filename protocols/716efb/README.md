12-channel reservoir (deck slot 5)
* channel 1: magbeads **vortexed and added to the reservoir immediately before beginning the protocol run**
* channel 2: DNAse
* channels 3-5: RNA buffer
* channels 6-8: magbead wash 1
* channels 9-11: magbead wash 2
* channel 12: DNAse/RNAse-free water

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the number of samples to process, the mount side for your P300 multi-channel pipette, the volume of beads to transfer initially (in Âµl), and the bead separation time (in minutes).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
