## Description
This protocol automates dilution of DNA in wells in a plate (Plate 1) with TE in a second plate (Plate2). The protocol does this using an input .csv file with 3 columns: plate1 (for the well location to transfer), DNA (for volume of DNA to transfer), and TE Buffer (for volume of TE to transfer). TE is loaded from a trough initially into Plate 2, and then the DNA is loaded into Plate 2 from Plate 1.

The protocol can transfer at 1-20ul of DNA and 20-200ul of TE into Plate 2.

## Process
1. Load TE into a single well trough on deck position 8. The amount of TE required will be slightly higher than the amount needed for dilution of DNA.
2. Load input Plate 1 into deck position 6, and an empty output Plate 2 into deck position 9.
3. Load p300 tips into deck position 7 and p20 tips into deck position 5.
4. Run the protocol!
