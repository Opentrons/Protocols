**Using the customizations fields, below set up your protocol.**
* **Number of Samples**: Specify the number of samples (1-48) you'd like to run.
* **P50 Single Mount**: Select which mount (left or right) the P50 Single is attached to.
* **P1000 Single Mount**: Select which mount (left or right) the P1000 Single is attached to.
* **MagDeck Incubation Time (mins)**: Specify how long (in minutes) the MagDeck should be engaged to create pellet, before removing supernatant.
* **Water Volume (for elution)**: Specify how much DNase/RNase-Free Water (in microliters) to add to each sample. This elution volume will then be split in two different wells in equal amounts.

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters.
2. Download your zipped protocol bundle and unzip the file.
3. Upload your custom labware defintion into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) (only need to do this once).
4. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2) (only need to do this once).
