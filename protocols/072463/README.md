## Description
This protocol performs the Simplified Fe Quantification Assay. If in Test Mode, the protocol will skip over all incubations and temperature changes. The protocol will automatically pause if tips have to be replaced, prompting the user. Pauses are included according to the protocol.

### Protocol Steps
1. User calibrates protocol on deck.
2. Deck starts with samples in the sample block and empty digestion plate in the heating module. The reagent
block is on the deck but only has water in Well A1.
3. Pipette 5-20 uL of water in triplicate from the reagent block into the digestion plate. (1 x 30 uL tip). Make the
pipetted volume user selectable and consistent for all samples.
4. Pipette 5-20 uL (same as in step 3) of each sample in triplicate from the sample block into the digestion plate.
(1-24 x 30 uL tips)
5. Add 990 uL of nitric acid from the acid block into each well of the digestion plate.
a. Use 300 uL single or multi-channel pipette and transfer multiple times.
b. Mix as a yes/no variable.
6. Pause so user can cover the digestion plate.
7. Raise heating block temperature to 95 °C and maintain for 12 h.
8. Cool heating block to room temperature. Wait for 1 h to ensure all samples reach room temperature.
9. Pause until user removes the cover from the digestion plate and places the reagent block and analysis plate on
the deck.
10. Transfer triplicate 10 uL aliquots from the 7 Fe calibration standards in the sample block into the analysis plate.
(21 wells; 7 x 30 uL tips)
11. Transfer 5-20 uL aliquots from each sample in the digestion plate into the analysis plate. (6-75 wells; 6-75 x 30 uL tips)
12. Add 36 uL of water from the reagent block to each well in the analysis plate. (27-96 wells; 1 x 300 uL tip)
13. Add 30 uL reagent A from the reagent block to each well in the analysis plate. (27-96 wells)
a. Mixing step.
14. Wait 1 h for reagent A to react with Fe in each well.
15. Add 49 uL of reagent B from the reagent block to each well in the analysis plate. (27-96 wells; 1 x 300 uL tip)
16. Add 75 uL of reagent C from the reagent block to each well in the analysis plate. (27-96 wells)
a. Mixing step.
17. OPTIONAL (yes/no variable) – transfer 200-900 uL from each well of the digestion plate into the sample storage
block. Write this so that 200 uL are transferred now because we are using a standard plate. Later will be
changed to 900 uL when we have custom labware with 1 mL shell vials. Samples may be stored for additional
measurements for up to 2 weeks. OT2 provides a CSV file with sample/replicate labels corresponding to
positions in the sample storage block. (6-75 x 300 uL tips)


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
