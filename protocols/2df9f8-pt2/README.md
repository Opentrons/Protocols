# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep

## Description
This protocol preps a 96 well plate by transferring 6ul from a source plate deepwell plate to a destination deepwell plate.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify the number of samples (1-94) to run on this protocol. Note: samples will be picked by row in the tube racks, in order of slots 7, 8, 10, and 11.
* `P20 Mount`: Specify which side to mount your P20 Multi Channel Pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. 6ul of solution is transferred from column 1 of the source plate to the destination plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
