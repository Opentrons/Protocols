# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Description
Learn the function OT-2 quickly! This simple plating protocol shows the flexibility of custom protocols hosted on our Protocol Library.

Reagents are transferred down columns and then across rows as shown here.

If the source labware is selected to be a 24x tuberack, reagents will be transferred in quadrupliate (ex: reagent tube A1 to destination labware wells A1-D1, reagent tube B1 to destination labware wells E1-H1, reagent tube C1 to destination labware wells A2-D2, etc.)

If the source labware is selected to be a 12-channel reservoir, reagents will be transferred column to column (ex: reservoir channel 1 to destination labware column 1, reservoir channel 2 to destination labware column 2, etc.)

### Reagent Setup
* Place your reagent arranged down the rows and then across the columns of your source labware.

### Protocol Steps
1. Reagents are transferred sequentially from the source labware to the corresponding positions of the destination labware.
2. If you are using the magnetic module, the module engages 18mm.
3. The protocol finishes execution and prompts the user for next steps.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
