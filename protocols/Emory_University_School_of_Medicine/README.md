## Description
This protocol allows the robot to dilute protein in buffer, based on desired dilution factor and final volume. The robot also creates two sets of serial dilutions of a competitor ligand in DMSO. The robot then creates a mixture of the diluted protein and a fluorescent ligand in buffer. DMSO is distributed to the first row of the target 384-well plate (2 uL/well). Each concentration from the serial dilutions of the competitor ligands is transferred (2 uL/well) to the each row of the target plate, starting at the second row. A 28 uL of protein/fluorescent ligand mixture is transferred into all wells containing either DMSO, or the competitor ligand.
