## Description
Part 2 of 4: Adapter ligation and User enzyme treatment.

Links:
* [Part 1: Fragmentation](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/4b4a80-fragmentation)
* [Part 2: Adapter Ligation](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/4b4a80-adapter_ligation)
* [Part 3: Size Selection](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/4b4a80-size_selection)
* [Part 4: PCR Enrichment](http://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/4b4a80-pcr_enrichment)

With this protocol, your robot can perform the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina E6177S/L protocol described by the [NEBNext E6177S/L](https://www.neb.com/products/e6177-nebnext-ultra-ii-fs-dna-library-prep-with-sample-purification-beads#Product%20Information). [NEB Instruction Manual for NEBNext E6177S/L](https://s3.amazonaws.com./pf-upload-01/u-4256/0/2021-02-16/8q531ae/manualE6177-E7805.pdf).

This is part 2 of the protocol: Adapter Ligation.

This step performs the ligation with the NEBNext Adaptor followed by U excision.

This protocol assumes up to 24 input DNA samples of > 100 ng and follows Section 2 of the NEB Instruction Manual.

After the ligation and user enzyme steps carried out in this protocol (part 2), samples may be held overnight at -20 C before proceeding with part 3: Size Selection. If you are stopping, seal the plate and store at -20 C.


## Protocol Steps

Set up: Pre-cool the temperature module to 4 degrees via settings in the Opentrons app prior to running this protocol. Add ligation mastermix, ligation enhancer, ligation adapter, and an empty vial to the 4 degree temperature module. Place the 96-well plate containing the fragmented DNA samples (the output from part 1, located in first three columns) on the thermocycler module.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Combine ligation mastermix + ligation enhancer + ligation adapter. Dispense this mixture to the fragmented DNA samples and mix.
2. Run the adapter ligation protocol on the thermocycler.
3. Add User enzyme to each post-ligation sample and mix.
4. Run the User enzyme treatment protocol on the thermocycler.
