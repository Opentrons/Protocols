# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page wonâ€™t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep
## Description
This is a specific protocol for aliquoting liquid from three reagent plates to three 96 deep well plates using a multi-channel p300 pipette. Tips are changed between reagents. Either pipette mount can be specified in setup.
* 350ul SPR Wash Buffer is added to a 96 deep well plate
* 350ul VHB Buffer is added to a second 96 deep well plate
* 50ul nuclease free water is added to a third 96 deep well plate

* 'P300-Multi Mount Side': Left or right refers to the pipette mount side

### Protocol Steps
1. A fresh tip is picked up.
2. 350ul of SPR Wash Buffer is transferred from slot 4 to individual wells on the 96 deepwell plate in slot 7 in two movements of 175ul. Using the 8-channel pipette, the transfer occurs from column 1 to column 11
3. Tips are deposited in the trash (slot 12)
4. A fresh tip is picked up.
5. 350ul of VHB Buffer is transferred from slot 5 to individual wells on the 96 deepwell plate in slot 8 in two movements of 175ul. Using the 8-channel pipette, the transfer occurs from column 1 to column 11
6. Tips are deposited in the trash (slot 12)
7. A fresh tip is picked up.
8. 50ul of Nuclease Free Water is transferred from slot 6 to individual wells on the 96 deepwell plate in slot 9 in a single movement. Using the 8-channel pipette, the transfer occurs from column 1 to column 11
9. Tips are deposited in the trash (slot 12)

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
