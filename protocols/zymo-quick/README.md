	* Zymo Kit


## Description
This protocol automates nucleic acid purification with the [Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Viral MagBead Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-viral-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-viral-magbead).</br>
</br>
Using the P300 Multi-Channel Pipette and a Single-Channel Pipette, this protocol can accommodate up to 48 samples per run and can be configured to run any multiple of 8 up to 48. Starting with 400µL of sample in a deepwell plate, the entire process is automated and ends with 60µL of elution containing nucleic acid dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate. The elution is then ready for RT/qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing, hybridization, etc.</br>
</br>
This kit can be used for Station B (RNA extraction) of our [COVID Workstation](https://blog.opentrons.com/how-to-use-opentrons-to-test-for-covid-19/).

**Reagent Preparation**</br>
Prepare all reagents according to Zymo manual.</br>
</br>
![Reagents in 12-Well Reservoir](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/zymo-rna-extraction/zymo_reservoir.png)
</br>
</br>
**Proteinase K**: In 1.5mL centrifuge tube, placed in "D1" in [Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) with 24-slot top.</br>
**Viral DNA/RNA Buffer + MagBinding Beads**: In slots 1, 2, and 3 in the 12-well reservoir. For every column (8 samples), 7mL of Viral DNA/RNA Buffer should be combined with 175µL of MagBinding Beads. Up to two columns (16 samples) worth of buffer+beads can be prepared in one Falcon Tube at a time. Each slot of the 12 well reservoir can accommodate volume for 2 columns/16 samples and should be loaded sequentially (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 1 would get 14mL buffer + 350µL beads, slot 2 would get 7mL buffer + 175µL beads, slot 3 would be empty).</br>
**MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 1**: In slots 4 and 5 in the 12-well reservoir. Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 4 would get 13.5mL, slot 5 would be empty).</br>
**MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 2**: In slots 6 and 7 in the 12-well reservoir. Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 6 would get 13.5mL, slot 7 would be empty).</br>
**Ethanol Wash 1**: In slots 8 and 9 in the 12-well reservoir. Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 8 would get 13.5mL, slot 9 would be empty).</br>
**Ethanol Wash 2**: In slots 10 and 11 in the 12-well reservoir. Each slot can accommodate enough volume for 24 samples (3 columns). Each slot would get 13.5mL if running 48 samples and would be scaled back if running less (ex. if running 24 samples, slot 10 would get 13.5mL, slot 11 would be empty).</br>
**Nuclease-Free Water**: In slot 12 in the 12-well reservoir. To accommodate 24 samples or less, 4mL of water should be used. For more than 24 samples, 4.5-5mL of water can be used.</br>

*Note about tips*: Each column of samples (8) requires ten columns of tips for this extraction. For 48 samples, all the tips in the five tip racks will be used; if running less than 48 samples, less tips/tipracks will be used and the tipracks will be accessed in this slot order: 1, 6, 9, 7, 10.</br>
