## Categories
* Nucleic Acid Extraction & Purification
	* RNA Extraction

## Description
This protocol extracts DNA using the ReliaPrep™ Viral TNA Miniprep System extraction kit. Proteinase K, patient sample, cell lysis buffer and isopropanol are combined with a ReliaPrep Binding Column. After 3 washes, water is added to the column to form the eluate which can then be plated.  


Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of samples`: Specify the number of samples for this run. Samples should always be placed by column (A1, B1, C1,..,etc.).
* `P20 Mount`: Specify which side (left or right) to mount the P20 single channel pipette.
* `P1000 Mount`: Specify which side (left or right) to mount the P1000 single channel pipette.

### Deck Setup

* On slot 2, empty tubes should be placed in the first 3 columns of the labware, which the protocol refers to as the "left side" when it pauses and prompts the user for instruction. Columns 4, 5, and 6 are known as the "right side" of the tube rack. Please see protocol steps below.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pro-K added to all tubes up to the number of samples on the "left side" of slot 2.
2. Samples are added to "left side" on slot 2.
3. Cell lysis buffer is added to the "left side" on slot 2.
4. Incubate for 10 minutes with a pause at the end of incubation. User selects "Resume" when they have populated tubes with binding column up to the number of samples on the "right side" of the tube rack on slot 2.
5. Isopropanol is added, mixed, and contents are transferred from "left side" to "right" side on slot 2.
6. User is prompted to centrifuge
7. 3 wash steps with pauses which prompt the user to centrifuge. User puts empty tubes on the "left side" of the tube rack on slot 2.
8. Water is added to "left side" of the tube rack.
9. User places binding column in water
10. Water is added to binding column + water on "left side"

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
