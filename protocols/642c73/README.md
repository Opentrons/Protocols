## Description
This protocol automates the creation of a PCR Plate with a variable number of samples.</br>
</br>
Using the [Opentrons 4-in-1 Tube Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) with [2mL Eppendorf tubes](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap?category=tubeRack), 20µL of pre-made master mix is added to PCR Plate. Following the addition of master mix to all necessary wells, 5µL of water is added for the negative control and 5µL of each sample is added to the other well(s).</br>
</br>
