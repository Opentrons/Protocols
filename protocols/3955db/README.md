# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Pooling

## Description
This flexible protocol automates the pooling of samples in 12mL tubes and the transfer of pooled samples to Visby device for rapid Covid testing.</br>
</br>

---
</br>
**Protocol Steps**</br>
1. The protocol begins by pooling samples (1-5) from Tube Racks in slots 2 and 3 into tubes in slot 5.
2. Once all samples are pooled appropriately, *total volume of pooled samples* will be added from pooled sample to Visby.

Explanation of adjustable parameters below:
* `P1000 Single GEN2 Mount`: Select which mount (left, right) the pipette is attached to.
* `Total Volume of Pooled Samples`: Specify the volume (in µL) that should be transferred to the Visby. This volume will be divided by the `Number of Samples per Pool` to determine how much volume from each individual sample when creating the pools. Example: if this is set to 500 and there are 5 samples per pool, 100µL will be transferred from each individual sample to the pooled sample tube, then 500µL of the pooled volume will be added to the Visby.
* `Number of Visbys`: Select the number of Visbys (1-6).
* `Number of Samples per Pool`: Select the number of samples to pool into one tube (2-5).

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
