# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
This protocol moves up to 384 samples from 1 source plate to 1 destination plate using a P50-multichannel GEN1 pipette. The source plate is a Greiner Bio-One 384-well plate, and the destination plate can be either a Corning 384-well plate or a Bio-Rad 384-well plate. Samples are transferred across row A (A1, C1, E1, G1, I1, K1, M1, O1; A2, C2, E2, G2, I2, K2, M2, O2; etc.), then across row B (B1, D1, F1, H1, J1, L1, N1, P1; B2, D2, F2, H2, J2, L2, N2, P2; etc.).
