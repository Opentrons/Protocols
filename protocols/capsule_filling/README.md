## Process
1. Load the plates of empty capsules into the robot to be filled.
2. Each capsule will need to be filled with the specified Fill Volume (in uL).
3. Once filled, operator will remove the plates, close the capsules, and remove them
from the plates.


### Additional Notes
After every run of the protocol, you will have to replace all the capsule plates with new plates and refill all of the tubes in the 2 tube racks. Please overfill them slightly, each 50ml tube needs about 51 ml for the protocol to work correctly for every capsule. The protocol runs on 8 plates at a time. Please also make sure the tip rack is reset every time as the robot starts over on the tip rack each time the protocol is run.
