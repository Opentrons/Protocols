## Description
This protocol preps a sample plate with up to 95 samples (with one control) as well as the necessary ethanol, buffer, and elution solution blocks. Mag beads are added to the sample. The protocol pauses if more than 45 samples are run to allow the user to replace sample tube racks. The P1000 Single channel GEN2 pipette tracks liquid height in 50mL tubes to prevent overflowing from submersion.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of samples`: Specify the number of samples that will be processed. Up to 95 samples can be run, leaving room for a control.
* `P1000 1.5mL tube aspiration height`: Specify the height (in mm) for the P1000 pipette to aspirate when visiting water, proK, or MS2 1.5mL tubes. Default is 1mm.
* `P1000 sample tube aspiration height`: Specify the height (in mm) for the P1000 pipette to aspirate when visiting sample tubes. Default is 1mm.  
* `50mL tube aspiration height`: Specify the height (in mm) for the P1000 pipette to aspirate from when visiting 50mL conical tubes. Default is 1mm.  
* `MagBead mix speed`: Specify the speed (in ul/sec) to mix mag beads.
* `P20 single GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P20 single channel pipette.
* `P1000 single GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P1000 single channel pipette.

### Reagent Setup
* 50mL Tube rack

* Note : if running 48 or less samples, prepare ethanol in only tube A1. If running more than 48 samples (including control), split the total ethanol required between tubes A1 and A2 (e.g. 24,000ul of ethanol in A1 for 24 samples, 25,000ul of ethanol and A1 and A2 for 50 samples).

### Protocol Steps
1. Buffer plate made according to total number of samples.
2. Ethanol plate made according to total number of samples.
3. Elution plate made according to total number of samples.
4. Proteinase K added to sample block
5. Samples placed on sample block. Protocol pauses if running more than 45 samples to replace sample tube racks. If replacing tube racks, samples should be loaded down by column starting from slot 1, then to slot 2 and so on.
6. Control added to sample plate.
7. Mag beads added to samples with pre-mix step to resuspend beads.
8. MS2 added to samples.




### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
