	* Swift Rapid RNA Library Kit

## Description
This protocol is one of a five-part series to perform Swift Biosciences Rapid NGS Library Prep kit. The protocol is split in such a way so as to allow for the option to run between the Rapid and Standard versions of the kit. Please find all linked parts of the protocol below:

Part one of this protocol is divided into the following methods for 8, 16, or 24 samples:

* Reverse Transcription
* SPRI Cleanup

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify the number of samples that will be processed.
* `Reverse Transcription Mastermix Overage Percent (0-10%)`: Specify the percent overage of Reverse Transcription Mastermix to make and ultimately add to samples.
* `Bead Drying Time`: Specify the amount of time after both ethanol washes are completed and the plate is spun down to let the beads dry.
* `Opentrons 96 Tip Rack 20ul Tip Type`: Specify whether filter or non-filter 20ul tips will be employed.
* `P300 Multi GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P300 multi channel pipette.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P20 single channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Reverse Transcription Mastermix is made on the Opentrons Aluminum 24 tube rack at 4C.
2. Mastermix is distributed to all sample wells and mixed.
3. Samples undergo thermocycler profile.
4. Samples are then moved to the magnetic module.
5. Magnetic beads are added to samples.
6. Samples are incubated at room temperature.
7. Protocol pauses - plate is removed from deck, sealed and spun down.
8. Plate is placed back on magnetic module.
9. Supernatant removed.
10. Two ethanol washes of samples with 30 second incubation periods before supernatant is removed.
11. Protocol pauses - plate is removed from deck, sealed and spun down.
12. Low EDTA TE is added to beads, incubate.  
13. Protocol pauses - plate is removed from deck, sealed and spun down.
14. Steps 5-13 are repeated.
15. Supernatant is moved to columns 9, 10, and 11.
16. Ligation Mastermix is made on the Opentrons Aluminum 24 tube rack at 4C.
17. Mastermix added to samples, plate spun down.
18. Samples undergo thermocycler profile.


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
