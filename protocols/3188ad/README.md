## Process
1. Input the mount side for your P50 multi-channel pipette, the transfer volume (in ul), the tip strategy (same tip for all transfers, or new tips for each transfer), and the tip column to select (if using the same tips for all transfers).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
