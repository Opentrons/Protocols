# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling


## Description
This protocol performs a Ribrogreen assay - for detailed protocol steps, please see below. There is the option to perform duplicate/triplicate plating. The csv for sample input should include `source slot, source well, destination well` in the header.

### Protocol Steps
1. Calibration standard preparation in deep well plate (matrix buffer addition)
2. Calibration standard preparation in deep well plate (4 ug/mL calibration stock addition)
3. Calibration standard plating (duplicate or triplicate)
4. Sample plating (duplicate or triplicate)
5. Triton addition
6. TE addition
7. Heating at 37 C for 10 minutes
8. Dye addition



### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
