# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* Swift Rapid RNA Library Kit

## Description
This protocol is part two of a five-part series to perform Swift Biosciences Rapid NGS Library Prep kit. The protocol is split in such a way so as to allow for the option to run between the Rapid and Standard versions of the kit. Please find all linked parts of the protocol below:

Links:
* [Swift NGS Part 1 - Reverse Transcription and SPRI Cleanup](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/6a93a2)
* [Swift Rapid NGS Part 3 - Extension, SPRI, and Ligation](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/6a93a2-part3)
* [Swift Rapid NGS Part 4 - SPRI Clean](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/6a93a2-part4)
* [Swift Rapid NGS Part 5 - Indexing and SPRI Clean](https://protocols.opentrons.com/protocol/6a93a2-part5)

Part two of this protocol is divided into the following methods for 8, 16, or 24 samples:

* Make Adaptase Mastermix
* Run Thermocycler Profile
* Add Adaptase Mastermix

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify the number of samples that will be processed.
* `Adaptase Mastermix Overage Percent (0-10%)`: Specify the percent overage of Reverse Transcription Mastermix to make and ultimately add to samples.
* `Opentrons 96 Tip Rack 20ul Tip Type`: Specify whether filter or non-filter 20ul tips will be employed.
* `P300 Multi GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P300 multi channel pipette.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to load the P20 single channel pipette.

### Protocol Steps
1. Adaptase mastermix is made on ice (4C)
2. User vortexes mix tube
3. Samples undergo thermocycler profile
4. User moves samples to ice for 4 minutes
5. Adaptase mastermix is added to samples
6. Samples undergo thermocycler profile
7. Samples are brought back down to 4C, ready for extension.




### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
