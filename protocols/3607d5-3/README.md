The protocol is broken down into 4 main parts:
* binding buffer addition to samples
* bead wash 2x using magnetic module
* final elution to chilled PCR plate

Samples should be loaded on the magnetic module in an Abgene Midi plate. For reagent layout in the 2 12-channel reservoirs used in this protocol, please see "Setup" below.

For sample traceability and consistency, samples are mapped directly from the magnetic extraction plate (magnetic module, slot 11) to the elution PCR plate (temperature module, slot 3). Magnetic extraction plate well A1 is transferred to elution PCR plate A1, extraction plate well B1 to elution plate B1, ..., D2 to D2, etc.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
