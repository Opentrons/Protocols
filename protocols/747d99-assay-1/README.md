    * RNA Extraction

## Description
This protocol is a full COVID-19 diagnostic workflow up to RNA amplification. Samples are loaded in 15ml tubes and transferred to 1.5ml tubes for lysis and temperature incubations on an Opentrons temperature module. The samples are then transferred to a deepwell plate mounted on an Opentrons magnetic module for a 1-wash magnetic bead-based RNA extraction.

Explanation of protocol parameters below:
* `track tips across protocol runs`: If set to `yes`, tip racks will be assumed to be in the same state that they were in the previous run. For example, if one completed protocol run accessed tips through column 5 of the 3rd tiprack, the next run will access tips starting at column 6 of the 3rd tiprack. If set to `no`, tips will be picked up from column 1 of the 1st tiprack.
