## Description
This protocol preps up to 12 columns of samples for PCR/qPCR. Reagent A is first added to the plate up the specified number of columns, then samples are reformatted from four tube racks to a 96 well plate on the magnetic module. The four tube racks exactly mirror the 96 well plate, and transfers are done one-to-one between the tube rack and plate by column (A1-D1 of tube racks on slot 4 then 1, A2-D2 of tube racks on slot 4 then 1, so on and so forth). Samples are then mixed, magnet engaged, and supernatant removed. After incubation period, reagent B is added, and the process is repeated through reagent C.


Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Columns`: Specify the number of columns on the magnetic plate to process.
* `Incubation Time`: Specify the incubation time in minutes
* `P300 Single Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 single-channel pipette
* `P300 Multi-Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to host the P300 multi-channel pipette

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
