## Description
For a detailed description of this protocol, please refer to the [Ligation Sequencing Amplicons Native Barcoding](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/onsite_egenesis_part2/manual.pdf)

Note: select the barcode numbered well to start from counting by column. "1" would be A1, "8" would be H1, "10" would be B2, so on and so forth.

### Protocol Steps
1. Make first mix.
2. Mixing and distribute first mix.
3. Pause for thermal cycling.
4. Distributing barcode.
5. Pooling samples.
6. Transfer beads to plate.
7. Incubating (hula step).
8. Remove supernatant.
9. Two ethanol washes.
10. Adding nuc free water.
11. Incubating (hula step).
12. Transfer to fresh well.
13. Make and add final mix.
14. Transfer beads to plate.
15. Incubating (hula step).
16. Removing supernatant.
17. Two washes.
18. Adding nuc free water.
19. Incubating (hula step).
20. Transfer to fresh well. 


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
