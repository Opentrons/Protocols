## Description
This protocol was built for Mass Spec sample prep for IPM doctors. It transfers a variable volume of reagent between 24 well input plate(s) and 24 well output plate(s). There are 3 custom labwares that this protocol normally uses - a 7ml tube rack (24 slot),  a 1ml autosampler tube rack (24 slot), and a 24 MCT laser cut acrylic rack.

2. Load tips at position 1. 
3. Run.
