This protocol performs the workflow of Cell Free DNA Target Enrichment as described in the [NONACUS Cell3™ Target Protocol Guide v1.2.2](https://nonacus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell3Target_Protocol_v1.2.2.pdf). This particular section is part 1 of the series, which kicks off the library Preparation.

Cell3™ Target: Library Preparation – 16, 48 or 96 reactions kits are available in two versions to prepare libraries from: (a) fragmented DNA and cell free DNA, and (b) intact genomic DNA samples.

Before you start, review the protocol guide to confirm kit contents and make sure you have the required equipment and consumables. Follow the instructions to set up the appropriate thermocycler program. See 'Additional Notes' below for reagent setup.

Once the protocol completes, immediately transfer the PCR plate to the pre-chilled thermocycler (4°C) and skip to the next step in the program. While the program is executing, you can set up the next part of the protocol and proceed immediately once the thermocycler program finishes.
