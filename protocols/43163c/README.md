## Description
This is a protocol to run a nanomaterial toxicity test. The nanomaterials get added at different concentrations to a plate, are dried, and then cells are exposed to the dried nanosheets. 

There are 3 steps to this protocol:

1. Nanomaterials are added at different concentrations to a 384 well plate. (drying done out of OT2 to make nanosheets)
2. Nanosheets are washed with PBS and bacteria are added to the sheets. (5hrs at 37.5c out of OT2)
3. Bacteria are removed from the nanosheets and the nanosheets are washed with PBS. (Plate ready for imaging on the Opera Phenix)

## Process
<<<<<<< HEAD:protocols/43163c/README.md
1. (Step 1) Load all labware. On the 12 well reagent reservoir, load 1:10 GO on column 1, 1:100 GO on column 2, MoS2 on column 3, 1:10 MoS2 on column 4, MoSe2 on column 5, and 1:10 MoSe2 on column 6. After running, remove experimental 384 well plate and dry at 60c.
2. (Step 2) Load all labware, including live bacteria. After PBS washes and adding of the bacteria, incubate at 37.5 for 5 hours.
3. (Step 3) Load all labware. After PBS washes, plate is ready for imaging.
