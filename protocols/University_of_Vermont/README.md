## Description
This protocol allows the robot to perform protein quantification, such as bicinchoninic acid (BCA) and Bradford protein assays.

### Robot
* [OT 2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

### Reagents
* Sodium acetate buffer
* Enzyme substrates
* Enxzyme standard

## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. Transfer 200 uL sodium acetate buffer to columns 1-3.
7. Transfer 50 uL sodium acetate buffer to columns 1, 4, 7, 10.
8. Transfer 50 uL enzyme standard to columns 2, 5, 6, 11.
9. Transfer 50 uL enzyme substrate type 1 to columns 3, 6, 9, 12, rows A-D.
10. Transfer 50 uL enzyme substrate type 2 to columns 3, 6, 9, 12, rows E-H.

### Additional Information
* Users have to manually remove tips from column 4 rows E-H, and column 5 rows A-D from the tip rack before starting the run.
