## Description
This protocol is designed for running tests with the Arcis Blood Kit with Opentrons Multi-Channel Pipettes and a 12-channel trough. (further instructions about the protocol can be found [here](https://arcisbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arcis-Blood-kit-Bulk-kit-UFL005-50rxn-IFU-Rev-6.12.2018.pdf)). With the Arcis Blood Kit, nucleic acid investigations can be performed easily and efficiently with the two included reagents. This protocol calls for the use of a P50-Multi and P300-Multi pipettes, as well as a 12-channel reservoir (USA Scientific), Corning 96-well, 360μL flat plate, and two Bioplastics 100μL plates.

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".

### Additional Notes
This protocol is meant for validation testing of the Arcis Blood Kit with the Opentrons platform (multi-channel), but can be used for DNA extraction in a small number of samples.
