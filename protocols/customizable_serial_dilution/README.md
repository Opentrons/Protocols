## Description
With this protocol, you can do a simple serial dilution in a 96-well plate using either a single-channel or multichannel pipette on the left mount of your OT-2. This can be useful for everything from creating a simple standard curve to a concentration-limiting dilution. You can use this as a standalone protocol or as part of a larger workflow. For more information (including results and other considerations), please see our [Technical Note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwSAS52fSBOEI0Hb7U2paq5jS_G1LN2fB5TssJp-Au0/edit?usp=sharing).

User-Defined Inputs
  * Pipette Type (defined for left mount only)
  * Dilution factor
  * Number of dilutions (max: 11)
  * Dilution volume 
  * Tip Reuse Strategy (default: reuse one tip throughout dilution series) 

Materials Needed
  * [Opentrons OT-2](http://opentrons.com/ot-2)
  * [Opentrons OT-2 Run App (Version 3.1.2 or later)](http://opentrons.com/ot-app)
  * 200uL or 300 uL Tiprack - [Opentrons tips suggested](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/opentrons-300ul-tips-racks-9-600-tips)
  * [12-row automation-friendly trough](https://www.usascientific.com/12-channel-automation-reservoir.aspx))
  * Clear flat-bottom 96-well polystyrene 96-well plate
  * Diluent (Pre-loaded in row 1 of trough
  * Samples/Standards (Pre-loaded in Column 1 of a standard flat-bottom 96-well plate)


### Time Estimate
* Varies. 2-5 minutes depending on pipette model chosen

## Process
1. Choose the pipette you want to use from the dropdown menu above. 
    * ***Note:*** Your pipette should be installed on the ***left mount*** of your OT-2.
2. Set your dilution factor. 
    * ***Example:*** If you want a 1:2 ratio of sample to total reaction volume, you would set your dilution factor to 2.
3. Set your number of dilutions (max = 11)
4. Set your dilution volume
5. Set your tip reuse strategy
    * ***Note:*** This defaults to no tip changes; adjust only if you want to change tips between each well.
6. Place your 12-row trough on the deck as indicated in the deckmap. **Make sure to add diluent to the first row of your 12-row trough.**
7. Place your 96-well plate on the deck as indicated in the deckmap. **Make sure to load your desired samples/standards into column 1 of your plate.**
8. Download your customized OT-2 Serial Dilution protocol using the blue "Download" button.
9. Upload into the Opentrons Run App and hit run!
