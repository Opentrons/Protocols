# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Plate Filling

## Description
This protocol preps a 384 well plate on the temperature module with reaction mix and sample. Reaction mix is held in well one of a 12 well reservoir on the temperature module. Both temperature modules are held at 4C. The protocol uses a multi-channel to fill full plates, and a single channel to fill the last unfilled plate. Samples and reaction mix are filled by row, skipping columns.


Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Specify the number of samples for this run.
* `P20 Mounts`: Specify which mount (left or right) for each the P20 Single-Channel and P20 Multi-Channel pipettes.

### Protocol Steps
1. Set temp on mod to 4C.
2. Use 8ch & single channel pipette to transfer 6ul of reaction mix (multi dispense) to 384 plate following attached grid according to sample number, using the same tips.
[Need sample number to determine following steps]
3. [For 1-96 samples] Use 8ch & single channel pipette to transfer 4ul of eluted sample from Plate 1 to 384 plate following grid, dispose of tips after each aspiration.
4. [For 97-192 samples] Use 8ch & single channel pipette to transfer 4ul of eluted sample from Plate 2 to 384 plate following grid, dispose of tips after each aspiration.
5. [For 193-288 samples] Use 8ch & single channel pipette to transfer 4ul of eluted sample from Plate 3 to 384 plate following grid, dispose of tips after each aspiration.
6. [For 289-384 samples] Use 8ch & single channel pipette to transfer 4ul of eluted sample from Plate 4 to 384 plate following grid, dispose of tips after each aspiration.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
