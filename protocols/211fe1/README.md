## Description
This protocol performs mass spec sample prep on up to 96 samples using an Opentrons thermocycler for incubation steps. Samples should be specified as comma-separated values on the first line of a `.csv` file, as in the following example:
```
A1,B1,C1,D1,E1,G1,B2
```

The samples are filled according to the order of the `.csv`, and invalid wells are ignored (valid wells must be `A1`-`H12`)

## Process
1. Upload your `.csv` file containing wells to process, and input the mount side for your P20 single-channel pipette, and the incubation temperature (in degrees C).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
