# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Covid Workstation
	* Sample Plating


## Description
This protocol automates sample plating from collection tubes to a 96-well plate. After sample plating (Station A), the plate containing samples can be used on Station B for RNA extraction as outlined in our [article on automating Covid-19 testing](https://blog.opentrons.com/how-to-use-opentrons-to-test-for-covid-19/).</br>
</br>
Using a [Single-Channel Pipette](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-pipettes/products/single-channel-electronic-pipette), this protocol will transfer the user-specified volume from sample tubes placed in the [Opentrons Tube Rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) into a 96-well plate. Users can specify which pipette, the type of source tube, the type of destination plate, the number of samples to transfer, and the volume of each sample being transferred.</br>
</br>

![Setup](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opentrons-protocol-library-website/custom-README-images/001-General+Headings/Setup.png)

The [Opentrons tiprack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips) should be placed in slot 3 and the 96-well plate should be placed in slot 2.</br>

With this protocol, the [Opentrons tube rack](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/tube-rack-set-1) with samples will be accessed in the following order: slot 1, 4, 7, 10, 5, 8, 11 -- see below for examples.</br>
</br>
**Using the customizations field (below), set up your protocol.**
* **Number of Samples**: Specify the number of samples to run (1-96)
* **Volume of Samples (in µL)**: Specify the volume to be transferred from sample tubes to destination plate (this volume should fall in the range of the selected pipette)
* **Destination Plate Labware**: Specify whether to use the [NEST Deepwell Plate, 2mL](https://labware.opentrons.com/nest_96_wellplate_2ml_deep?category=wellPlate) or the [NEST PCR Plate](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/verified-labware/products/nest-0-1-ml-96-well-pcr-plate-full-skirt) as the destination plate
* **Source Tube Labware**: Specify whether to use the Opentrons Tubebrack (24) with [2mL](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_24_tuberack_nest_2ml_screwcap?category=tubeRack), [1.5mL](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_24_tuberack_nest_1.5ml_screwcap?category=tubeRack), or [0.5mL](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_24_tuberack_nest_0.5ml_screwcap?category=tubeRack) tubes or the Opentrons Tuberack (15) with [15mL](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_15_tuberack_falcon_15ml_conical?category=tubeRack) conical tubes.
* **Pipette Type**: Specify which pipette (p300/p1000 GEN1/GEN2) to use (should be mounted on the right gantry)
