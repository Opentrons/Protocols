## Description
The protocol performs liquid handling to prepare up to four 96-well plates of mammalian cells for luciferase reporter assay.

The luciferase reporter assay is used to investigate the regulation of expression of a gene of interest. This method relies on reporter cells created by stable or transient transfection of a promoter-driven, luciferase-expressing DNA. The bioluminescence proportional to luciferase expression can be quantified to assess the functional connection between the expression of the target gene which is controlled by this promoter, and the factor to be studied which may exhibit a regulatory effect on the cell behaviors at the transcription level. In this particular example, HeLa cells are stably or transiently transfected with an NF-kB promoter-driven, luciferase reporter construct, treated with an NF-kB activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and activation of NF-kB assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity.

Cell suspension preparation:
Mammalian cervical cancer cell line HeLa (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or HeLa-originated cell line with a sequence of NF-kB response element upstream of luciferase-expressing DNA integrated in the cell’s genome (Cellomics Technology, Halethorpe, MD, USA) is maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HeLa cells are detached by using trypsin, resuspend in DMEM and poured into a NEST 12-well reservoir. To prepare one 96-well plate cell culture, for the assay that requires transient transfection to prepare reporter cells, resuspend 1/4 of cells collected from a confluent 100 mm tissue culture dish (~ 2.2 x 106 cells) in 11 mL DMEM. For the assay using the pre-engineered cell line stably expressing luciferase reporter, resuspend 1/2 of cells collected from a confluent 100 mm tissue culture dish (~ 4.4 x 106 cells) in 11 mL DMEM.

### Reagent Setup

1. A NEST 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL filled with suspended cells in Well 1 to Well 4 (for up to four 96-well plates) loaded on Slot 6 (CELL STOCK)
2. Corning 96 Well Plate 360 µL Flat loaded on Slot 2, 5, 8 and 11
3. An Opentrons 96 Tip Rack 300 µL loaded on Slot 3


### Protocol Steps
1. Transfer cell suspension from Slot 4 (CELL STOCK, Well 1) to 96-well plate on Slot 2 (100 µL per well)
2. Transfer cell suspension from Slot 4 (CELL STOCK, Well 2) to 96-well plate on Slot 5 (100 µL per well)
3. Transfer cell suspension from Slot 4 (CELL STOCK, Well 3) to 96-well plate on Slot 8 (100 µL per well)
4. Transfer cell suspension from Slot 4 (CELL STOCK, Well 4) to 96-well plate on Slot 11 (100 µL per well)
5. Continue cell culture incubation (off deck)


### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
