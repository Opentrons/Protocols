## Description
With this protocol, your robot can fill up to 9 96-well plates with reagents from a 96-deep well  block using a P300 multi-channel pipette. Column 1 of the 96-deep well block will be distributed into column 1 of all the defined 96-well plates. Column 2 of the deep-well block will be distributed into column 2 of all the defined 96-well plates. The rest of columns will be filled in the same fashion until all plates are filled. User can define the number of plates to be filled and the volume to be transferred into each well. User can decide whether to discard the tips or to return them back to the tip rack.
