## Process
1. Input the mount side for your P10 multi-channel pipette, the number of daughter plates to map to (1-6), the start column for mapping (inclusive), the end column for mapping (inclusive), the transfer volume (in µl, up to 10), and the dispense plan (either one-to-one transfers, or multi-dispenses from the same source).
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
