## Description

This protocol uses a p300 multi-channel and p300 single-channel pipette to transfer up to 57 samples plus serial dilutions of IgG, IgM and IgE standards to 384-well ELISA plates.

This protocol was developed to transfer up to 57 samples from eppendorf tubes in 24 tube racks to 96-well sample prep plates, then transfer and serially dilute IgG, IgM and IgE standards in a sample prep plate, followed by transfer of samples and serial dilutions to three 384-well ELISA plates. The sample arrangment for the tube racks, sample prep plates and ELISA plates is shown in the attached excel spreadsheet.

## Protocol Steps

Set up: 24 tube racks containing up to 57 initial samples in deck slots 1, 4 and 7. 96-well sample prep plates in deck slots 2 and 5. 384-well ELISA plates in deck slots 3, 6 and 9. p300 tips in slots 10 and 11.

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. transfer samples to sample prep plates in duplicate (arrangement shown in attached excel spreadsheet)
2. transfer IgG, IgM and IgE standards and make serial dilutions in the sample prep plate (arrangement shown in attached excel spreadsheet)
3. transfer the samples and serial dilutions to three 384-well ELISA plates (arrangment shown in attached excel spreadsheet)
