## Process
1. Download your protocol.
2. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
3. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
4. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support article](https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/deck-calibration).
5. Hit "Run".
6. The specified volumes of reagents are transferred to their corresponding destinations on both the outlet and inlet trays. Volume is tracked throughout the process to ensure that the pipette does not submerge in reagent.
