# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Pooling

## Description
This protocol performs a custom sample pooling from a source PCR plate to a 1.5, 2, or 5ml Eppendorf tube. Sample locations and volumes are specified via .csv file in the following format, including the header line (empty lines ignored):

```
source plate well,volume sample (µl)
A1, 28
C4, 12
```

The proper pipette for a given volume is automatically calculated. Tips are changed for each transfer.

You can download an example .csv to edit directly [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/pooling/ex.csv).

## Process
1. Input the normalization .csv file, and the respective mount sides for your P10 and P50 GEN1 single-channel pipettes.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
