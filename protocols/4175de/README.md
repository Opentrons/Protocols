# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep


## Description
This protocol performs a custom cherrypicked PCR/qPRC prep. It requires a CSV input for the source and destination wells of the samples. It will automatically add mastermix based on the number of samples inputted to the PCR plate sequentially (A1-12 then B1-12, etc...).

### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the total sample number (used for distributing mastermix to variable number of wells sequentially), select P20-single channel mount, select PCR plate on top of the Temperature Module, and upload a CSV with sample transfer data. [Download an Example CSV](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/4175de/pcr_data.csv)
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
