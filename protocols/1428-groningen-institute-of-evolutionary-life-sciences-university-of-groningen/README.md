## Description
This protocol gives your robot the ability to perform microsatellite genotyping for 96 samples with 4 different Multiplex PCR master mixes. [Non-skirted 96-well plates](https://www.4ti.co.uk/pcr/standard-PCR-qPCR-plates/96-well-standard-non-skirted-plates) will be used for this protcol. A P10 multi-channel pipette is required. Your sample plate will be maintained at 4Â°C on the [TempDeck](https://shop.opentrons.com/products/tempdeck).
