## Description
This protocol performs a custom cherrypicking from a 4x6 Opentrons tuberack containing 2ml Eppendorf tubes to an IDT 96-deepwell plate, and back to new tubes on the tuberack. The information for this workflow should be input in `.csv` file formatted as shown in the following example (**including headers**):

```
Label,Pos,nM,FC,Rxn,Vol,h2O,Tube
P_F3,A1,28.9,0.8,100,10,30,T1
P_B3,A2,28.32,0.8,100,10,,T1
P_FIP,A3,53.8,1.6,100,20,,T1
P_BIP,A4,82,1.6,100,20,,T1
P_LF,A5,32.5,0.4,100,5,,T1
P_LB,A6,29.4,0.4,100,5,,T1
P_F3,A7,28.9,0.8,100,10,35,T2
P_B3,A8,28.32,0.8,100,10,,T2
P_FIP,A9,53.8,1.6,100,20,,T2
