### Robot
* [OT-2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)

## Process
1. Input the respective mount sides for your P10 and P300 multi-channel pipettes and the number of samples to process.
2. Download your protocol.
3. Upload your protocol into the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app).
4. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
5. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
6. Hit "Run".
