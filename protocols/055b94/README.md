# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* PCR
	* PCR Prep


## Description
This protocol provides a custom qPCR prep on the OT-2 for up to 4x source 96-well plates into 1x destination 384-wellplate. Mastermix is prepared manually and transferred to each reaction well on the OT-2.

Each protocol run generates an output .csv file that is compatible with Quantstudio instruments. To retrieve the file, launch a Jupyter Notebook server on your robot by following [these instructions](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Uploading-files-through-Jupyter-Notebook). The file will be named after the 9000 plate barcode scan, followed by ".csv."

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit "Run".
