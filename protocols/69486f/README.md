# NGS Library Prep

### Author
[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/)


# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after March 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* NGS Library Prep
	* KAPA HiFi

## Description

This custom protocol performs part 2 of the [KAPA HiFi NGS Library Prep kit](https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/products/sample-preparation/library-amplification/kapa-hifi-kits.html). The protocol can accommodate up to 8 samples. The operator is prompted to perform PCR and normalization off-deck.

The number of samples and subsamples should be specified in a .csv file formatted as follows:

```
sample index,# subsamples
1,1
2,2
```

You can also access a template file [here](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/69486f/ex.csv).

### Deck Setup

Note that these deck states depict a combination of the maximum number of PCR 1 forward primers.

Starting state (showing normalization for <= 28 sample + subsample product):  
![deck1](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/69486f/deck1-5.png)  
* green on slot 1: starting samples according to above example .csv
* clear on slot 7 (tubes A1-D2): empty tubes for PCR 1 mix creation
* orange on slot 7 (A3-D4): unique PCR 1 forward primers (in column order)
* clear on slot 7 (tubes A5-D6): empty tubes for PCR 2 mix creation
* blue on slot 8 (A1): water
* pink on slot 8 (B1): PCR mastermix

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
