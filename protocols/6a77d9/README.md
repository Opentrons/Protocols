# Opentrons has launched a new Protocol Library. This page won’t be available after January 31st, 2024. [Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYYp9QCKow4nn0KlCVsMS3HX0eJ0N9O7-erajKvcpT0lWbSg/viewform) to add this protocol to the new library.

## Categories
* Sample Prep
	* Slide Spotting

## Description

This protocol performs simple spotting transfers of variable volume to a custom plate occupying slots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9 of the OT-2 deck.

**Calibration**  
The user should calibrate to the top left-most spot of the top left-most grid on the shaker (A). The pipette tip should be calibrated to just above the center of this spot during calibration.

**Offsets**  
Offsets are used to define the location of each additional grid. The offset of the top left-most spot of each additional grid (B) relative to the calibration point (A) will be specified in a pair of x- and y-coordinates via 	`.csv` file input, as in the following example (be sure to include the header line):
```
x offset (in mm),y offset (in mm)
50,0
0, 70
50, 70
```

The above example will transfer to 3 grids with specified offsets in addition to the starting grid to which the protocol is calibrated.

* If using a multi-channel pipette, liquids A-D should be in reservoir wells A1-D1, and liquids E-H should be in reservoir wells E2-H2.  
* If using a single-channel pipette, liquids A-H should be in reservoir wells A1-H1.

## Process

1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
