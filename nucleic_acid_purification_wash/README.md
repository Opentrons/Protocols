## Description
Purify nucleic acids with L Buffer, Ph-Ch-Isoamyl, Isopropanol, and Ethanol washes.

### Reagent locations in trough:

* Trough row 1 = L Buffer
* Trough row 2 = Ph-Ch-Isoamyl mix
* Trough row 3 = Isopropanol
* Trough row 4 = Ethanol

### Time Estimate
TBD

### Reagents

## Process
1. Transfer 300 ul of L buffer from trough to 96 well deep well plate (same tips)
2. Transfer 180ul of Ph- Ch-iso-amyl mixture to the 96 well deep well plate.
3. Transfer the top layer from the 96 well deep well plate a fresh 96 well plate.
4. Transfer 280ul of Isopropanol to this new plate with top layer.
5. Remove the isopropanol and discard it.
6. Transfer 450 ul of ethanol and wash the pellet.
7. Remove the ethanol and discard it.
