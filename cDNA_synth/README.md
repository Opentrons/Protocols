## Description
1. Transfer 5ul of nuclease free water from 2ml tube rack to all wells
in 96 well plate (same tip) -- this is cDNA synthesis plate.

2. Transfer 10.0 μl of first strand master mix (2×)  from 2ml tube rack
to all wells in 96 well plate (same tip) (cDNA synthesis plate)

3.  Transfer 3.0 μl of oligo(dT) primer  from 2ml tube rack
to all wells in 96 well plate (same tip)(cDNA synthesis plate)

4. Use single channel to add 12 μl of AffinityScript RT/ RNase Block
enzyme mixture from 2ml tube rack to all wells to PCR strips (A to H)

5. Use multichannel to add 1 μl of AffinityScript RT/ RNase Block
enzyme mixture from PCR strip to 96 well plate.(cDNA synthesis plate)

6. Use multichannel to add 1ul of sample from 96 well plate to
96 well plate (well A1 to A1, B1 to B1)===== cDNA synthesis plate

7. Incubate for 1.5hr for cDNA Synthesis

8. Transfer 1 μl  of cDNA to another 96 well plate using multichannel
such well A1 to A1, B1 to B1. (qPCR Plate)

9. Transfer 12.5 μl of 2× Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR master mix
to 96 well plate (qPCR plate)

9. Transfer 2.5 μl of Primer mix from 2ml tube rack to all wells in 96 well plate
(qPCR plate)
